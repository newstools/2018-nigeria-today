Following the end of a week in which he professed his love for US President Donald Trump and said something about “dragon blood,” Kanye West has decided to release a song titled Lift Yourself. The lyrics of song confirm his support of the Trump administration to the disappointment of many of his fans. Lift Yourself also works around a gospel sample, builds in a bass-heavy beat, then descends into a farce as West starts spouting gibberish about Poopa Scoopas. Listen to “Lift Yourself” here. It’s the only thing on www.kanyewest.com right now. Following the release of “Lift Yourself,” Kanye debuted more new music with a politically charged song featuring T.I. called “Ye vs. The People.” Listen to that one here.
