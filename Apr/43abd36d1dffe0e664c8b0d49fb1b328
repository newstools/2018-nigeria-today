 Ripple price is slowly moving upwards against the US Dollar and Bitcoin. XRP/USD could gain upside momentum and it may perhaps break the $0.5000 resistance. Yesterday, there was a downside reaction from well above $0.5000 in Ripple price against the US Dollar. The price declined and tested the $0.4750 support, which acted as a barrier for sellers. A support base was formed above the $0.4750 level and the price started an upside move. It traded above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the last decline from the $0.5110 high to $0.4740 low. At the moment, the price is trading nicely above the $0.4800 level and near the 100 hourly simple moving average. However, the 50% Fib retracement level of the last decline from the $0.5110 high to $0.4740 low at $0.4925 is acting as a resistance. A break above the $0.4925 level is needed for a push above the $0.5000 barrier. Above the mentioned $0.5000, the price may continue to rise towards the $0.5100 and $0.5200 levels. On the downside, there is a key bullish trend line forming with support at $0.4850 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair.  The pair remains supported near the trend line at $0.4850. Below the trend line support, the $0.4750 level remains a major buy zone. The overall price action is positive as long as the price is above $0.4800. Looking at the technical indicators: Hourly MACD – The MACD for XRP/USD is slightly in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for XRP/USD is just around the 50 level. Major Support Level – $0.4800 Major Resistance Level – $0.5000  Charts courtesy – Trading View  The post Ripple Price Technical Analysis – XRP/USD Remains Supported appeared first on NewsBTC.
