If you’re one of those peeps who likes to send pictures of your quality nugs over WhatsApp, then you might want to exercise a little caution. Jokes, because there’s no way the SAPS have the kind of technology at their, um, fingertips. Over in South Wales they do, and the pioneering fingerprint technique has now been used to convict a drugs gang who sent images over WhatsApp. The BBC with the deets: Apparently they’re working on a side project which matches up unsolicited dick pics with the guy who sent them. OK, they’re not, but you should know that the girl you sent those to has shown her friends and they all laughed at you. For an explainer of sorts, here’s Dave Thomas:  Helluva effort, chaps. A further warning from Thomas: You might even have to change the name your weed dealer is listed under in your phone. I’m hoping Thomas goes after people who share motivational quotes with sunrises behind them on social media next, but I’m not holding my breath.
