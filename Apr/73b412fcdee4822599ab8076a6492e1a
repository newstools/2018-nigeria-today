President Cyril Ramaphosa shook his booty this weekend at the Limpopo coronation ceremony of the Queen of Balobedu, and damn, the man can move. How old is he again? Based on the hype about his bad-ass bum movements, Business Insider felt it necessary to ask two of SA’s specialists in the field, Jack Mawasha (CEO of Limpopo-based Jama Studios) and Strictly Come Dancing SA’s all-star Salome Sechele, to score the president’s performance. For now, you be the judge:  What do the experts think?  Mawasha gave the president a seven out of 10, because: Sechele was slightly more excited:  Her praise was only worth an eight, leaving Cyril with a combined score of seven and a half out of 10. This isn’t the first time a political figure was caught cutting shapes, with former US President Barack Obama being well-known for his snap and click:  According to Obama, it’s all about staying cool: But Cyril was having none of that.
