If you’ve ever stayed in a room with a windowsill, you might know about pairs of pigeons. They make ungodly noises, cover everything in crap, and aren’t exactly welcome house guests across the world. A pigeon pair, on the other hand, is much sought after. If you’re still playing catch up – as I was when I started writing this – a pigeon pair is “a boy and girl as twins, or as the only children in a family”. So having two kids, a boy and a girl – yeah, that’s it. To those without children, myself included, who gives a rat’s arse. Parents around the world, however, will probably be able to tell you that it’s quite a big deal. To begin with why it’s called a pigeon pair, as we promised in the headline, here’s Parent24:  So that she can date his older friends? How very convenient, and what a nightmare for the older brother. Of course, like with everything these days, the term has become the grounds of much contestation. Here’s a piece on Stuff, titled “A pigeon pair: Why is having one boy and one girl seen as the pinnacle of parenthood?”: Things get far more heated on Mama Mia, because Mama ain’t happy: You want to know what I think? You probably don’t care, and neither do I. Happy pigeon pairing or not pigeon pairing, breeders. Do you have something awesome to share with the world?
