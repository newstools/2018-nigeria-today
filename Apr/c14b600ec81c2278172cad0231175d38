Armed with his family’s credit card and his passport that he managed to trick his grandmother into handing over, a 12-year-old boy flew to Bali because “he wanted to go on an adventure”. The trip was triggered by a family argument, so says The Guardian, and the boy, who was told he couldn’t go to Bali by his mother, managed to “book himself flights (researching an airline that allowed 12-year-olds to fly unaccompanied) and a hotel room, and to depart the country unimpeded”. Telling his family he was going to school, he “rode his razor scooter to his local train station”, took a train to the airport, used a self-service check-in terminal, boarded a flight for Perth and then another for Indonesia. That simple. Throughout the ordeal, the boy was only quizzed once, when he arrived at Perth and staff asked him for identification to prove he was over 12: Once in Bali, he checked in to the All Seasons hotel, telling staff he was waiting for his sister to arrive. Ridiculous. Making the trip independently, he was fetched by his mom, who was no doubt furious, nine days later: Hilarious. A Current Affair’s take on the situation:  But this wasn’t the first time. The boy had previously tried to fly with Qantas and Garuda, but both airlines turned him away before he could board a plane, and allegedly notified the Australian Federal Police and Border Force about his attempts. That’s the reason why his family had hidden his passport in the first place.
