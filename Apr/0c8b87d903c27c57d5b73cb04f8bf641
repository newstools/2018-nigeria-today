High Court of the Federal Capital Territory, yesterday, restrained the Nigeria Police Force, Department of
State Service, DSS, and the Attorney-General of the Federation, AGF, from arresting or threatening
Senator Ovie Omo-Agege. The embattled senator was briefly detained and questioned by the police on Wednesday after he was
arrested at the premises of the National Assembly.
Senator Omo-Agege was suspended from the Senate on April 12 over his allegations that a bill for the
reordering of election sequence was targeted at President Muhammadu Buhari.
The senator later apologised to his colleagues after the Senate had directed its Ethics and Privileges
Committee to investigate the matter.
The committee eventually recommended the embattled senator’s suspension.
However, on Wednesday, the suspended senator resurfaced at the National Assembly.
The Senate spokesman, Abdullahi Sabi, later accused Senator Omo-Agege of leading the unknown
persons who broke into the Senate’s session and carted away its mace.
But in a statement on Wednesday evening, the senator denied the allegation.
He said he was at the National Assembly to resume sittings “based on legal advice and his understanding
of the current position of the law.” Do you have something awesome to share with the world? Click here to share Do you ever have any question about anything you wish to ask and get answer?
