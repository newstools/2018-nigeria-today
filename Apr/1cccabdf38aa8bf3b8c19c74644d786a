Award winning Nigerian Singer, Wande Coal has shared his side of the story in an ongoing fight with his baby mama. Recall that few days ago, his baby mama, Temitope came out on social media to accuse him of snatching their child from him. She stated that Wande Coal gave his parents the child to take care of and that they prevented her from seeing the 10-year-old boy. Reacting to her accusations, Wande Coal via a statement said that everything his baby mama has said is a lie. Wande said that the only truth in her accusations is that she is the mother of his child. He revealed that she (baby mama) didn’t tell him she was pregnant but got married and passed off the child as her husband’s own.
