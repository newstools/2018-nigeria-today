There was pandemonium in Unilag yesterday, after a final year student of the school was arrested for stealing her boyfriend’s ATM card which she used in buying an iPhone 8 and X on Jumia. The suspect who also bought other items on the online store was nabbed, after her boyfriend in collaboration with Jumia, traced the buyer to Unilag’s Moremi Hall where the delivery was made. An eyewitness account on the arrest of the Unilag student who was handed over to the school’s DSA, reads; “It appears, she’s been scamming guys with her friends for a long time. When the Jumia officials came to the hostel, she hid the phones in a bag and threw them in the dustbin. The girl is actually using an iPhone 7 Plus. However, upon realizing what was happening, the boyfriend demanded that the case be dropped.” Do you have something awesome to share with the world?
