 Big Brother Naija 2018 housemates were on Friday thrilled when Biggie surprised them with a visit to the house by Pepsi ambassadors DJ Spinall and DJ Obi. The Pepsi ambassadors taught housemates the act, using the Amplifier and other equipment. Miracle was announced winner of the this week’s ‘Pepsi challenge’. He was the first housemate to complete his task after finding the missing DJ pictures. He was gifted a one year free supply of Pepsi products for a whole year, a ticket to ”One Africa” music festival and N1 million cash prize.
