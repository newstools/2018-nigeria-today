Nigerian couple celebrate News made the rounds this time last year when Oluwakemi Funmilayo Aminu and her husband Mark Imudia Uduehi, welcomed to their family and the world at large, a set of quintuplets. It’s been one year now and the couple are celebrating their set of quintuplets on their first birthday – the toddlers were born in Abuja, when Uduehi from Ekpoma in Esan West Local Government Area, was then unemployed while his wife was a civil servant with the Nigerian Population Commission Abuja. The Federal Government gave Uduehi a job with the Nigeria Building and Road Research Institute (NBRRI), Abuja. The couple was also given a three bedroom bungalow in one of the estates under the Federal Integrated Staff Housing (FISH) Scheme.
