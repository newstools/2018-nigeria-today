 Big Brother Naija Host, Ebuka Obi-Uchendu took to his Instagran page to share this photo as he stepped out for an Owambe function yesterday looking expensive and classy in a beautifully designed native outfit, Agbada. He captioned the photo; “Owambe Fridays…#TheGMWedding Agbada by @deco_d29” This has left ladies drooling over him despite the fact that he is happily married.
