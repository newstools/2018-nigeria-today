You might be forgiven for thinking that this week’s Carpool Karaoke stars one Kylie Jenner, at least until she opens her mouth and starts singing. Belting out some of her biggest hits, Christina Aguilera rode shotgun alongside James Corden. But unlike the makeup-free look we saw a couple of weeks ago, this time around Aguilera was styled very much like a low-key Kardashian. But we forgive her. Only because she dished the dirt on what went down back in the day between her fellow “Mickey Mouse Club” co-stars Britney Spears, Justin Timberlake and Ryan Gosling: Then, at the 3:15 mark, a surprise appearance was made by actress Melissa McCarthy, aptly standing in for Redman as she gave her own rendition of his lines from Aguilera’s 2002 hit “Dirrty”. We couldn’t think of anyone better to do so:  So refreshing to have a good singer who actually knows her words, hey? [source:youtube] Do you have something awesome to share with the world?
