My favourite magic trick is watching invites to things I don’t want to attend disappear, but if you’re after real magic then Marc Spelmann is your jam. Quite an apt name to have when you’re casting spells, man. The 46-year-old blew the Britain’s Got Talent judges right out the water with his skills, with this from Telly Mix: Oh, and of course there was an emotional hook too: Right, I’ve said enough. Wow us, Marc:  Consider me wowed. Turns out Marc isn’t a one-trick pony, and Radio Times have another gem for you to enjoy:  Get out of my head, bruh. Then there’s some card wizardy, of course:  OK, that’s quite enough. Do some work. [sources:tellymix&radiotimes] Do you have something awesome to share with the world?
