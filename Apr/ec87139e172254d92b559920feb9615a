England’s men had won gold less than 20 minutes prior to the race, and a team of Asha Philip, Dina Asher-Smith, Bianca Williams and Lorraine Ugen ensured that they would also be standing atop the podium with a national-record time. A blistering second leg from Asher-Smith took England into the driving seat at the halfway stage of the race, and Williams increased that lead going into the home straight. It looked at one stage as though Ugen might be caught by the Jamaicans on the inside lane, but she held off the challenge of double Olympic champion Elaine Thompson to claim gold by just 0.06s. The Jamaican quartet of Christania Williams, Natasha Morrison and Gayon Evans were forced to settle for silver as they surrendered their title from Glasgow four years ago.
