Is this a robbery or an Audi R8 hijacking attempt? I’m still not sure to be honest. These guys are either new to the profession of vehicle repossession (better known as hijacking), or they were after something else. Man, I’m happy I left Jozi. A Benoni mom and her son, who have both chosen to remain anonymous, were the victims of an all-too-familiar occurrence on Friday afternoon, with CCTV footage capturing the moment they were robbed at gunpoint outside a house. TimesLIVE reports: The thugs then proceeded to pull open the doors of both the driver and passenger, before robbing the occupants and driving away:  The passenger told Benoni City Times that her son was dropping her off at home when they were ‘boxed’ in, and that the reason he reversed into the vehicle was because he knew they wouldn’t take a damaged product. The result? A gun pointed at his head: This is a lesson, folks. Always keep your house keys readily available, especially when you’re pulling into a driveway in Benoni.
