Once again, Beyonce slayed her 2-hour set in the second weekend of Coachella, replicating the stunning performance alongside her dancers and marching band that broke the internet last weekend. The pop star was again joined by Destiny’s Child’s Kelly Rowland and Michelle Willams, her husband JAY-Z, and her sister Solange Knowles. Beyonce channeled her inner Egyptian Queen Nefertiti, rocking a black-diamond bodysuit, and then a silver one with a matching cape. She and her dancers later rocked pink outfits.
