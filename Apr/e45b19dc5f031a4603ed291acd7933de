The Muslim Rights Concern (MURIC) has requested that the federal government withdraws from circulation, the N100 notes printed during the administration of former President Goodluck Jonathan. In a press release issued on Tuesday by the Director of MURIC, Prof Ishaq Akintola, the group said the action of the former President was a major failure of his administration. The group alleged that the N100 notes printed during Jonathan’s government were inferior and had no Arabic Ajami inscriptions. Akintola also alleged that the removal of the inscription was a form of “ethnic cleansing” aimed at discouraging the learning and use of Arabic language in Nigeria. MURIC called for the withdrawal of Jonathan’s N100 note from circulation and the reinstatement of Arabic Ajami on N200, N500 and N1,000 denominations.
