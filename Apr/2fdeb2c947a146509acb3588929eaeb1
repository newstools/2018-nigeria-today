‘You have got to be kidding me’ is one of John McEnroe’s catchphrases, and now and again he pops up in an ad or movie to cash in on his notoriously bad temper. It looked like he had passed the baton on to Nick Kyrgios, the Ozzie player who has made a habit out of being a knob on court, but then up stepped American Jared Donaldson. This one is straight out of the ‘toddler wailing in the corner’ playbook, taking place during the second set of his first-round Monte Carlo match against Albert Ramos-Viñolas yesterday. Here’s NewsAU: That’s the bit where he spits out the dummy and stamps his feet on the ground. Here’s the first part of the brat’s behaviour, showing the serve itself, and the meltdown beginning in earnest at the 30-second mark:  And then what came next:  Something tells me ‘supervisor, supervisor, supervisor’ isn’t going to have the same staying power as McEnroe’s ‘are you kidding me’. The little twat didn’t even shake the umpire’s hand at the end of the match, which he lost 3-6, 3-6:  Definitely voted for Trump. Looks like the Prince, Roger Federer, might have to tell young Jared how the game of tennis is supposed to be played. [source:newsau] Do you have something awesome to share with the world?
