 Controversial Big Brother Naija 2018 housemate, Cee-c has revealed her favourite housemate and its a surprising pick. Cee-c, speaking with Big brother during her diary session, named Khloe as her favourite. According to her, “Koko has a lot of fears and she is very funny.  “Khloe makes me laugh and taught me so much from her life experiences.” “Since her return to the house, I have been able to see beneath the whole troublesome personality.” Cee-c told Biggie. Recall that Khloe on her return to the house told Ebuka that she came back to frustrate Cee-c. However, it seems her hatred for Cee-c has been defeated as both housemates have become friends.
