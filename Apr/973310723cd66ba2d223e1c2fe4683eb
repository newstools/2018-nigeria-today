You can almost see the expats in Perth rubbing their hands together with glee. It’s clear that tensions between the South African and Australian governments are sky-high, with Australian immigration minister Peter Dutton’s comments about white farmers here in SA setting in motion some heated exchanges. Ozzie travel advisory website smartraveller.gov.au has clearly decided to stick the knife in, and the advice they’re dishing out on behalf of the Australian government’s department of foreign affairs and trade is less than complimentary. Via Times LIVE, here’s what some Ozzies are hearing when they consider a visit: They forgot to add that we will humiliate their cricketers, and that they should bring their own sandpaper. Must be talking about Cape Town drivers when it rains at the end there, because three spots of rain and everything goes to shit. Of course many of those barbed insults hit the mark, and we can’t bury our heads in the sand and pretend otherwise, but the stern warnings have led to SA Tourism spokeswoman Thandiwe Mathibela expressing concern: Scouring the news like we do means seeing your fair share of bad news, but wander around any of Cape Town’s premier tourist spots and you’ll see visitors beaming from ear to ear. I think I saw a foreigner weeping with joy at Kirstenbosch this past weekend, although it may just have been a small domestic dispute. Anyway if this story reaches Australia, via the wonders of the internet, I say this – play nice, ya bloody drongos. [source:timeslive] Do you have something awesome to share with the world?
