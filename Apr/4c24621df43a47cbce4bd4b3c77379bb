Governor of Ekiti State, Ayodele Fayose has blasted president Muhammadu Buhari for calling Nigerians youth lazy. In a statement on Twitter, Fayose maintained that Nigerians youths are hardworking, intelligent and enterprising. “Nigerian youths are hardworking, intelligent and enterprising. Their future was mortgaged by past leaders like President Buhari, who had everything at their beck and call as youths. I imagine the youths of today having half of the opportunities available in the 50s and 60s…” he said “At 19, President Buhari left Secondary School to join the Army. At age 21,he was commissioned a second lieutenant and appointed Platoon Commander of the Second Infantry Battalion in Abeokuta, Nigeria. Where can our youths get such opportunity today?” he added. Do you have something awesome to share with the world?
