Depending on the area, warning posts trickle through Facebook and WhatsApp groups, sharing with communities the most recent sightings of a dangerous woman that has become notorious in certain areas: After a reader reached out to us, asking if we knew anything about the woman, we did some digging. Turns out there’s plenty about her online, and her modus operandi goes a little something like this: Targeting unsuspecting drivers (usually male, usually alone), she requests lifts. Once the caring individual has started driving, she tends to make small talk before demanding money. If denied, she even goes so far as to threaten to accuse the driver of rape. If she approaches you in shopping centres, she will physically assault individuals and make huge scenes if denied money. She has been spotted in areas as far south as Kommetjie, and between Muizenberg and Hout Bay. The bottom of Ou Kaapse Weg and Military Road intersection are two favourite spots. Oh, and she is easily identified by a teardrop tattoo on her face, hence the name “Teardrop”:  And some more shots of her in action:    A Facebook post by Kelly Kisten gave some more details: If you have yet to encounter Teardrop, count yourself lucky. Otherwise, be vigilant. As much as this woman needs help, it’s really difficult to give it if she doesn’t want it. Do you have something awesome to share with the world?
