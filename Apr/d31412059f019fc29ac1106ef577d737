Banky W has reacted to the comments made by President Muhammadu Buhari on the attitude of the Nigerian youth. Buhari, while speaking at the Commonwealth Business Forum, had said a lot of youths in Nigeria want to sit around and do nothing. Banky W shared a short clip of the president speaking on his Instagram, and asked that whatever Nigerians think about what the president said, the important thing is to go out and vote during the 2019 elections. He asked that people go and register to get their permanent voters card (PVC).
