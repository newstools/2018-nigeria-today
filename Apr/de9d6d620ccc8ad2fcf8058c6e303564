Akinwunmi argues that the team would have no problem facing the task of competing against the best at the world cup. The Football administrator believes that having one of the lowest average age among the 32 participating nations is going to be a plus for the Nation in subsequent events. Akinwumi said experience for the Super Eagles players will come with game time and that the aspiration to be the best will keep driving the team.
