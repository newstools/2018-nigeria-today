Arhavwarien Kingdom in  Ughelli South Local Government Area of Delta State, has appealed to the state government and the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC), to construct   a bridge that will link the community to the outside world, and boost economic activities in the community. Chief Frank Efole, who spoke on behalf of the community explained that the community had made several efforts in the past to construct the bridge but the project was  capital intensive which the community could not afford. He argued that with the construction of the bridge, the community would have easy access to other communities to market their goods and services, noting that, the absence of the bridge had affected their economic activities.
