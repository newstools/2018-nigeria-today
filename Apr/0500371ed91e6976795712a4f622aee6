The Referees Committee of the Confederation of African Football (CAF) has confirmed the recommendation of its Disciplinary Board to ban Nigeria referee, Joseph Ogabor, from any official mission for one year over attempted match manipulation. It is understood that Ogabor attempted to manipulate the centre referee, Victor Gomes, for the Total CAF Confederation Cup play-off round first leg clash between Plateau United of Nigeria and USM Alger from Algeria played on 7 April 2018 in Lagos. He attempted to help the NPFL champions outfit gain an unfair advantage over its Algerian counterpart. A statement on CAF website on Sunday said the decision follows investigations conducted and evidence submitted by the South African match officials of the match who were contacted by Ogabor to provide “technical assistance” to the Nigerian team.
