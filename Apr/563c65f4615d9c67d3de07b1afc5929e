This follows Bithumb’s announcement that it will supply kiosks to restaurants, cafes, and other eateries, to facilitate crypto payments as well as a partnership with a travel site with over 5,000 accommodation facilities. The company is also launching a service to allow crypto payments at approximately 8,000 physical stores through a partnership with Korea Pay’s Service.
