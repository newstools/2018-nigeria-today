The party’s National Organising Secretary, Sen. Osita Izunaso, who inaugurated the committees in Abuja, said screening was mandatory for all aspirants. He charged the committee to continue in the APC’s tradition of adhering to due process and to ensure fairness during the exercise. Izunaso said that the committees should rely on the party’s 2014 guidelines for the nomination of candidates for public office. He also said that the committee should be guided by the party’s Constitution and the amended 1999 Constitution in carrying out the assignment.
