It’s pretty easy to tell when you’re getting under Donald Trump’s orange skin, because he will usually attack you on Twitter. Today was another example of that, and just before lunch local time, which would be 6AM over in Washington, Donnie opened up his favourite app and bashed out a few tweets. The failing New York Times was the first order of the day – by now they must barely bat an eyelid at this kind of rhetoric:  Boring. Now Trump has been bashing the New York Times for years, but maybe this latest attack stems from an editorial they ran on Tuesday night. Titled “The Law Is Coming, Mr. Trump”, it didn’t hold back. Enjoy: Now we know that Donnie cried wolf about this being a total witch hunt, but the truth is somewhat different: Yeah, that’s exactly what Trevor Noah took the piss out of earlier this week. Here’s something that we shouldn’t forget, either: the meeting during which Donald complained about being victimised was called to deal with the chemical weapons attack on Syrian civilians, but again turned into a circus: Burn. But also wow, what a truly sad state of affairs. It’s often said that democracy means you get the president you deserve, so it’s almost like America has some kind of bad karma going on. I wonder what that could be about? Perhaps Trump’s biggest con job is that fake tan and hairdo. Oh, you want to see what he would look like without fake tan?  You asked.
