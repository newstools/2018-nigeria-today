Those in the know describe Syria as the greatest humanitarian crisis of our lifetimes, and the recent chemical strike on its citizens is another example of just how evil President Bashar al-Assad and his regime are. On April 7 the chemical attack took place in the Eastern Ghouta region, a final rebel stronghold near the capital Damascus. The BBC reports that “two bombs filled with chemicals were reportedly dropped several hours apart on the town, allegedly targeting civilians hiding underground from regular bombs”. Gas, which is heavier than air, then seeped down into the basements, which left women and children ” foaming at the mouth, with discoloured skin and corneal burns”. The international reaction to that event was swift, with the likes of America, France and Britain responding with a barrage of missiles aimed at crippling the country’s chemical weapons capabilities. We covered the before and after pictures from those airstrikes here, but let’s move onto the New York Times and their harrowing short video on what it’s like to endure aerial attacks. It comes with this description: As you can imagine, it’s nothing short of awful:  Really helps put your problems into perspective, right? By the way, Russia claims that the attack was staged, and the country also stands accused of tampering with chemical weapons sites ahead of visits by chemical weapons inspectors. All politics aside, those are real people, and real children, running in fear of their lives. [source:bbc&nytimes] Do you have something awesome to share with the world?
