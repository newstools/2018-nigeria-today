Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, has asked the federal government to secure the release of 14-year-old Christian Leah Sharibu from Boko Haram’s custody. The Archbishop made the request when he met with President Muhammadu Buhari in London on Tuesday. According to a statement by the Archbishop on Twitter, he also offered support in seeking a sustainable solution to the herder-farmer conflict and expressed deep concern about raids on Christian communities and villages as far south as Delta State, which have led to many deaths and threaten worse violence. In such tragedies, the poor suffer most.     Do you have something awesome to share with the world? Click here to share Do you ever have any question about anything you wish to ask and get answer?
