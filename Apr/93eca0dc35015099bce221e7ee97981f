By Funmi Peter-Omale I was on my way to my sewing class one morning recently and thought it was too early to have breakfast. As I walked to the station in London, I noticed this Nigerian grocer near the station was already opened. I decided to cross over the road to pick up a fish pie and a packet of plantain crisps to snack on at lunch (my class finishes at about 3pm). Do you have something awesome to share with the world?
