Jeez guys, do we have to do everything for you? We joke, because you’re special to us, and we just want you to live a long and fulfilling life. Enough – it’s Ryan Reynolds time. The Deadpool 2 trailer dropped last week, and if you haven’t seen it yet then we’re both surprised and a little disappointed. Here’s what the trailer says about the much-anticipated sequel: Look, it’s Deadpool, and the last trailer racked up huge views, and this one has seen more than 13 million eyeballs already. Let’s get weird:  Peter looks like he is going to be a jol, and if you’re a fan of Catastrophe then you’ll recognise Rob Delaney. He’s a gem, and so is Catastrophe. Consider this your in to a few seasons of magic:  Before we forget, Deadpool 2 hits cinemas on May 18. Our work here is done. [source:youtube] Do you have something awesome to share with the world?
