 Ethereum price is rising sharply against the US Dollar and Bitcoin. ETH/USD is now well above the $440 pivot level and eyes upsides above $500. Yesterday, we saw a decent start of an upside move above $425 in ETH price against the US Dollar. The price gained upside momentum and it succeeded in breaking a crucial pivot level at $440. It cleared the way for more gains and the price rocketed above the $480 level. It even pierced the $500 level and traded as high as $503.34. At the moment, the price is consolidating gains above the $480 level. It recently declined below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the last wave from the $450 low to $503 high. However, the downside correction was limited by the $480-484 support area. Moreover, the 38.2% Fib retracement level of the last wave from the $450 low to $503 high acted as a support. It seems like there is a solid support forming above the $480 level. There is also a major bullish trend line forming with support at $440 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.  Therefore, it seems like the price is placed nicely above $480 and is preparing for more upsides. A proper close above the $500 level could open the doors for further gains. If there is a downside correction from the current levels, the broken resistances at $480 and $440 are likely to provide supports. Hourly MACD – The MACD is placed nicely in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI – The RSI is currently near the 70 level. Major Support Level – $480 Major Resistance Level – $500  Charts courtesy – Trading View  The post Ethereum Price Technical Analysis – ETH/USD Back in Uptrend appeared first on NewsBTC.
