 Ripple price is preparing for the next move against the US Dollar and Bitcoin. XRP/USD is likely to break higher above $0.6900 if buyers take control. There was no major move above the $0.6800 level in Ripple price against the US Dollar. The price remained in a tight range above the $0.6400 support and it seems like it is preparing for the next move. The recent low was formed at $0.6473 before the price moved back above $0.6500. It traded above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the last drop from the $0.6821 high to $0.6473 low. The best part is the fact that yesterday’s highlighted contracting triangle with current support at $0.6450 is still active on the hourly chart. The pair is well supported above the $0.6450 and $0.6400 support levels. On the upside, an initial resistance is close to the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the last drop from the $0.6821 high to $0.6473 low. However, a proper break above the $0.6800 resistance is needed for further gains. Above $0.6800, the price may attempt to surpass the $0.6900 and $0.7000 resistance levels.  The chart suggests that the pair is soon approaching a major break either above $0.6800-0.6900 or below the $0.6400 support. If it breaks down and clears the $0.6400 support, there could be an increase in bearish pressures. Below $0.6400, the next major support awaits near the $0.6000 level.
