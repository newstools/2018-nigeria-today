SCROLL TO THE BOTTOM OF THE STORY FOR THE UPDATE… When news broke that a “Cape Town DJ” had been arrested for the possession of drugs, with an estimated street value of at least R2,6 million, people immediately looked at the likes of those who played at CTEMF for answers. Especially since he was arrested after the Hawks raided his house on Hastings Street in Tamboerskloof, reports News24. However, after a little digging, we discovered that Die Son had let his identity slip. Apparently, the DJ in question is known as the “Godfather of Deep House”, and had been working at Goodhope FM until his contract expired recently and wasn’t renewed. He was arrested along with his wife, and the two co-accused are expected to appear in the Cape Town Magistrate’s Court today.   According to Hawks spokesperson Captain Philani Nkwalase, the “joint intelligence-driven operation – which combined teams from the Hawks’ South African Narcotics Enforcement Bureau (SANEB) and Crime Intelligence – arrested the men‚ aged 39 and 48‚ at the house”: According to Die Son, the police informant wasn’t so diplomatic: Love it. If you’re not into house music, or listening to GoodHope FM, the man in question is one DJ Dino Michael:  He should probably change the name of his Facebook page, because in light of what has happened DJ Dino Michael Syndicate is not a good look.
