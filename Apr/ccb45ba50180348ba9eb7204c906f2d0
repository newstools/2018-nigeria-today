This injury is coming on the heels of those suffered by players like Ogenyi Onazi, Leon Balogun, Tyronne Ebuehi and recently Joel Obi. “I hope it is not a serious injury for Ndidi and I hope he can play in the World Cup,” said Puel after the game. “All the scenarios today were bad for us. We will see (if he will make the World Cup). It is a hamstring injury. I hope it is not serious of course because it is an important moment for him.” This season, Wilfred Ndidi has played 45 games in total for club and country, logging 3,920 minutes. “It is a worrying development.
