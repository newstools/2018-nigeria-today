Arsene Wenger’s long tenure at Arsenal will come to an end after the French manager officially agreed to step down from his role as manager at the end of the season. The 68-year-old had one year left to run on his contract and had continually insisted he would see out the remainder of his deal despite another underwhelming campaign. Arsenal currently sit in sixth place in the Premier League table but are in the semi-finals of the Europa League, which will now be Wenger’s last shot at winning silverware with the club he joined in 1996. Wenger has come under increasing pressure to step down from his role, and now has finally decided to make way after extensive talks with the board. A statement from Wenger explained: ‘After careful consideration and following discussions with the club, I feel it is the right time for me to step down at the end of the season. ‘I am grateful for having had the privilege to serve the club for so many memorable years. I managed the club with full commitment and integrity. ‘I want to thank the staff, the players, the Directors and the fans who make this club so special. ‘I urge our fans to stand behind the team to finish on a high. To all the Arsenal lovers take care of the values of the club.’ Wenger won three Premier League titles during his time in charge of Arsenal, but has gone 14 years without being champions of England. He also oversaw seven FA Cup wins, making Arsenal the second most successful club in the competition’s history. Arsenal have already been linked with a host of replacements for the legendary French coach, with former skipper Patrick Vieira, ex-Dortmund coach Thomas Tuchel and Juve boss Max Allegri among those in the frame.
