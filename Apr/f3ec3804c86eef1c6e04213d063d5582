 Singer Wande Coal had earlier this week been involved in some drama. A woman named Temitope came forward to say their son of 10 years was abducted by the singer 8 years ago. According to the report, she had dropped out of secondary school at 16 after being impregnated by a then 23-year-old Wande Coal. Although he denied that the child was his, the report said, he later accepted him after a paternity test was done. The mother, Temitope, said she’s been unable to see her child since then. She alleged that Wande Coal and his mother had abducted the child and refused her access to him. Wande Coal has debunked Temitope’s account, telling his own side of the story. Temitope was 20 when they met, he said. He added that the report about her being refused access to the child is a lie.
