 Evicted housemate Lolu has insinuated that Cee-C might be obsessed with Tobi as she can’t keep his name off her mouth. Tobi and Cee-c engaged in a near-fight argument on Wednesday. The fight resulted to Biggie issuing warning strikes to Cee-c while Tobi was given “Big Brother’s advice.” Lolu, who was evicted on Sunday said Cee-c always had a way of bringing Tobi into anything she said.  He said, “From the Cee-c’s angle, she cannot go ten minutes without referring to anything that concerns Tobi. “Even if the question is hi am I on to pulse TV? Cee-c has a way to get pulse TV to Tobi and Tobi to pulse TV.” The post #BBNaija2018: What Lolu said about Cee-c and Tobi appeared first on INFORMATION NIGERIA.
