A 55-year old man Moses Ayemojuba has been arrested for allegedly using a forged Catholic Church bank cheque to defraud an oil company, Nathhole Petroleum Limited to the tune of N8m. It was gathered that the incident happened at Christ the King Catholic Church in Shasha, Lagos where the transaction took place. It was gathered that the suspect and others at large approached the management of the company to supply the church 30,000 liters of diesel worth the amount about N8m. They promised to pay the money through a bank cheque with serial number 000055 after the company might have supplied the product. Not knowing that it was a scam, the management delivered the product with their truck at the church premises and the suspect issued the cheque on behalf of the church. However, when the company took the cheque to Ecobank PLC it was discovered that the cheque did not emanate from the church. By then the suspects had sold the diesel and escaped with the money.
