 This has to be clear case of a certain paid employee who handles the twitter handle of the General Overseer of the Redeemed Christian Church, forgetting that he/she was still on the G.O’s handle and tweeted this.

See tweet below:  The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) declared in the early hours of Sunday that the recall exercise on Saturday had failed after electorate overwhelmingly sat at home.
