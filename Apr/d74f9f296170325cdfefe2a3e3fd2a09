Killer husband Peter Nielsen Dane man, Mr. Peter Nielsen, accused of killing his wife and daughter, is yet to be charged with any offence, his legal representatives, Primera Africa Legal (PAL), said on Tuesday. Police detectives from the State Criminal Investigation and Intelligence Department (SCIID), Panti, Yaba, are investigating Nielson over the death of his artiste wife, Zainab Ali-Nielsen and her four-year-old daughter, Petra.  It was alleged that the duo were murdered in the family’s Banana Island, Ikoyi, residence, in the early hours of April 5. PAL’s Senior Partner, F. Boma Ayomide Alabi, said in a statement that Mr. Nielsen “is fully cooperating” with the investigators at the Lagos State Criminal Investigation and Intelligence Department (SCID). She sought transparent investigation and access to the Danish national by his lawyers, adding that the suspect has not been charged and the cause of death was unknown.  Alabi said there had been “largely inaccurate and speculative public and media narrative”against her client. The spokesman of the Lagos State Police Command, Chike Oti, had said Nielsen was detained at the SCIID.  comments The post Suspected killer husband, Peter Nielsen not yet charged – Lawyers appeared first on INFORMATION NIGERIA.
