Sergio Aguero is facing a race to be fit for this summer’s World Cup finals in Russia, with the striker recently going under the knife after picking up a knee injury in Manchester City’s loss to crosstown rivals Manchester United two weeks ago. Argentina’s doctor Homero D’Agostino has issued an update on the City striker’s fitness, telling Radio 10 that the 29-year-old frontman will not arrive in Russia fully fit having completed an arthroscope: Aguero is set to miss the remainder of the campaign with City but it remains to be seen if he will recover ahead of Argentina’s World Cup opener against Iceland on June 16. City’s top scorer this season with 30 goals in all competitions, Aguero has not started a game since March 4 but made late substitute appearances in the home defeats to Manchester United and Liverpool. D’Agostino believes surgery was the only option left for Aguero. The post Aguero Won’t Be ‘Fully’ Fit For World Cup appeared first on 360Nobs.com.
