The church of Satan has blasted President Muhammadu Buhari for describing the Benue Catholic Church killing as ‘Satanic’ In a statement on Twitter, the church of Satan maintained that the fighting is an infighting between two different Abrahamic religions and called the president ignorant for making such a misguided utterances. The church of Satan equally blasted the media for furthering this superstitious nonsense President Buhari is ignorant. Infighting between two different Abrahamic religions is just that, theists killing theists. It has nothing to do with us or Satanism – a life cherishing atheistic religion. Shame on the media for furthering this superstitious nonsense. https://t.co/uLexUUui06 — The Church Of Satan (@ChurchofSatan) April 26, 2018  Do you have something awesome to share with the world?
