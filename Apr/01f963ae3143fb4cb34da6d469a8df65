The video clip he shared on Instagram, which has been taken down now, showed him playfully kissing a woman. According to BBC Africa, the award-winning star issued an apology saying: I’ve had a long conversation with the authorities and I have learnt that what I did was not right.As a role model to many young people, not just in Tanzania but across the continent, posting a private moment was irresponsible of me.
