The tiny western European country that is Luxembourg has dreams. Like, out-of-this-world dreams. Of all the aspirations in the world, they have set their sights on asteroid mining, one of the “most hyped industries of the future,” reports NewsWeek. Why? Well, it could have something to do with Astrophysicist Neil DeGrasse Tyson’s prediction that the “first trillionaire will make their fortune by exploiting asteroid resources”: But Luxembourg has long had a foot in the game: the country is home to one of the largest satellite operators in the world, its government invests in companies hoping to pursue asteroid riches, and it has made it possible for corporate groups to lay claim to space’s resources. Now that’s some forward thinking. So what can one find on these asteroids? Well, there are two kinds of resources: precious metals and water: Interestingly, the water isn’t there to bring back to save Earth. Rather, water can be split to form hydrogen gas, which can power rockets and get those carrying the precious metals back to Earth: In other words, petrol stations in space. The mind boggles.
