Self-acclaimed Port Harcourt First Son and dancehall singer, Duncan Mighty has debunked the rumour that he acquired his enormous wealth through illegal oil bunkering. While speaking with Saturday Beats, the singer mentioned that he has always had in mind that people must bear the belief that he is into something illegal to have been so wealthy. He said: However, the singer disclosed that he invested so much in construction and building and that is where the bulk of his money comes from and not even from music. In his words; He seized the opportunity to advise his colleagues in the music industry currently making fame and money to leverage on their earnings now while they are still in demand because tomorrow might be too late.
