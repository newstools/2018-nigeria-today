Many Springbok rugby fans thought our scrumhalf problems had been solved when Faf de Klerk turned out for the green and gold, and he certainly got off to an impressive start. Remember those try-saving tackles against Ireland? Fast forward to 2018 and Faf is now plying his trade overseas for the Sale Sharks, and it’s clear that he isn’t shying away from the physical stuff. This past weekend Sale came up against Wasps, and Faf came to face to face with Dan Robson and Danny Cipriani. Sport24 reports that “Cipriani was knocked out cold, while Robson also left the field after a few minutes of receiving attention”. Other than a shiner, de Klerk looks right as rain:  As for Dan and Danny, they recovered:  If you’re keen to see Faf back at nine for the Boks, there is some good news: No disrespect to those two chaps, but I would pick Faf ahead of both.
