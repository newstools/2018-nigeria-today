 Ripple price moved back in a bullish zone recently against the US Dollar and Bitcoin. XRP/USD could correct lower but downsides are likely to be limited below $0.6000. There was a fresh upside wave initiated above the $0.6000 level in Ripple price against the US Dollar. The price traded higher and broke a few important resistances such as $0.6500 and $0.6600. It traded close to the $0.7000 level before it faced sellers. A high was formed at $0.6993 before the price started a downside correction. It declined and traded below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the last wave from the $0.6238 low to $0.6993 high. Moreover, the XRP/USD pair is currently trading below a short-term bullish trend line with support at $0.6800 on the hourly chart.
