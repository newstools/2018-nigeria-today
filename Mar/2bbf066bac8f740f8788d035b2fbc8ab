The All Progressives Congress in Ekiti state has accused Governor Ayodele Fayose of attempting to hijack the Federal Government’s N-Power scheme in the state to his advantage. Publicity Secretary of the APC in the state Taiwo Olatunbosun in a statement in Ado-Ekiti the state capital accused the governor of double standards. “It is amusing that a governor who believes that he is in government for self-enrichment and who has never hidden his anti-people conducts by refusing to encourage job-creation schemes and always wishing Buhari’s administration bad luck in its welfare programmes could suddenly attempt to hijack N-Power to his advantage,” he said. He chided the governor over the rate of unemployment in the state stating that over 1,400 youths had lost their jobs in the state within just one year of the governor being in office. “He closed down Ecobank, making 11 of its staff from Ekiti State to lose their jobs while he severed working relationship with Zenith Bank that has several Ekiti people as workers for acting professionally in not aiding crime in Fayose’s alleged involvement in arms cash-for-election fraud in the state. “He sacked over 500 youths in Ekiti State Peace Corps while reducing youths in EKSMA (Dagrin) from 800 to 100 making 700 jobless, including reduction in the numbers of street sweepers and cutting their pay by half while he also sacked 100 youths engaged in Youth in Commercial Agriculture Development scheme. “Fayose cannot sack 200 youths in the House of Assembly, cancel 400 jobs at EKSU, cancel 30,000 appointments made by former Governor Kayode Fayemi, reverse promotions for head-teachers, sack permanent secretaries, sack street sweepers, reduce running grants for civil servants,’ he said.
