Frontline Igbo politician and elder statesman Professor Ben Nwabueze has revealed that a Nigerian president of Igbo extraction will be impossible through the ballot box . Prof Nwabueze while speaking to newsmen yesterday said except the Nigerian constitution is reviewed and allows for rotational presidency, the dream of an Igbo man being president of Nigeria was very slim. “Igbo presidency is possible only when rotation is written in the constitution. If it is the turn of the Igbo, they will know whether there are 10 or 20 candidates, only one of them, Igbo, will emerge. “The political forces are so aligned against Igbo presently, and unless there is rotation, Igbo presidency will never materialize through ballot box, unless by way of providence, as in the case of former President Jonathan,” he said.
