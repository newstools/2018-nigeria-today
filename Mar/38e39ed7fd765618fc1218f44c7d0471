Anthony Joshua believes his world heavyweight unification clash with New Zealander Joseph Parker in Cardiff on Saturday week in front of another huge stadium crowd will provide the sternest test of his career. The International Boxing Federation and World Boxing Association heavyweight champion clearly has huge respect for his opponent, whom he believes is a “better all-round” fighter than the World Boxing Council champion Deontay Wilder. Joshua, who made the fifth defence of his IBF title against Carlos Takam in the same venue last October, will earn close to £20?million for his latest fight, with Parker, the World Boxing Organisation champion, set to net a career-high £7?million. “It will be my toughest style match-up,” said Joshua at his training camp, the English Institute of Sport in Sheffield. “People want to see how good you are with every fight. You can’t rest on your laurels in boxing. One win doesn’t define you. People want to see how long you can keep reigning as the king of the jungle.” The post Anthony Joshua confident of keeping his title against Parker appeared first on Vanguard News.
