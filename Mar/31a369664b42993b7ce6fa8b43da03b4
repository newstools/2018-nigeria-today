Deputy governor of Imo state, Eze Madumere says nobody can stop him from becoming the next governor of the state. According to the statement signed on his behalf by his spokesperson Uche Onwuchekwa, the deputy governor likened his betrayal from those he managed and nurtured to limelight politically to that of the betrayal of the Lord Jesus Christ, who was also betrayed by those he loved and called his friends. He vowed that no man born of a woman can stop him from becoming the next governor of Imo state, saying that God remained the ultimate decider of anyone’s future. Recall that the state governor, Rochas Okorocha,  had earlier endorsed Uche Nwosu, his son-in-law, as his successor.  “He is a very humble young man. Not proud. Not arrogant. So, power won’t enter his head. In spite of the position he occupies, you can’t see him quarrelling with anybody or maltreating anybody. He does not segregate anybody, whether from Orlu or Owerri or Okigwe zone. He relates with people enviously. “Zoning does not put food on the table of anybody. What the state wants is Imo governor and not Owerri zone or Orlu zone or Okigwe zone governor. The young man is a team player who does not use his office to molest anybody. He has the qualities of a good leader. If he says he will run for governor, I will support him” Okorocha noted.  Do you have something awesome to share with the world?
