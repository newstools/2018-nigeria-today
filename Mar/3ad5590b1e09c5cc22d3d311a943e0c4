Back in May of last year, Stellenbosch was rocked by the murder of 21-year-old student Hannah Cornelius. Cornelius and Cheslin Marsh were hijacked in Bird Steet, Stellenbosch, and footage later emerged of police chasing the then suspects. Sadly the family has now suffered another loss, with Hannah’s 56-year-old mother Anna found dead yesterday. News24 reports:  Times LIVE spoke with Ian Klopper‚ National Sea Rescue Institute station commander at Kommetjie: The four men accused of the murder of Hannah – Vernon Witbooi‚ Eben van Niekerk‚ Geraldo Parsons and Nashville Julius – will appear in court on April 20, with the trial having been pushed back because the defence hadn’t received all of the state’s evidence against the men.
