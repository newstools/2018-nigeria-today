Italy legend Roberto Baggio believes that Juventus will beat Real Madrid in the UEFA Champions League quarter-finals. Baggio – who represented Juve between 1990 and 1995 – has predicted that Paulo Dybala and Gonzalo Higuain will make a pivotal contribution in what is a repeat of the 2017 final. The 51-year-old Gazzetta dello Sport: “This season is great. Napoli are doing very well. I think Juventus are a little bit ahead with [Paulo] Dybala and [Gonzalo] Higuain. “Let’s talk about two exceptional players. If you think Dybala is great, look at what Higuain did against Tottenham. Two crazy things. Even though Real Madrid will be a challenge, I believe that Juventus can compete with them.” The post Roberto Baggio Backs Juventus To Defeat Real Madrid In The UEFA Champions League Quarter-final appeared first on 360Nobs.com.
