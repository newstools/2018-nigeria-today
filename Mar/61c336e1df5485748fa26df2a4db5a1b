Speaker of the house of representatives, Yakubu Dogara, says powerful people are trying to use the democracy to gag the legislature but said the house cannot be intimidated. Dogara stated this in plenary on Thursday, while speaking on a motion raised by Razak Atunwa from Kwara state on the recent court judgment restraining the house from holding a public hearing on the hijab controversy. Dogara noted that powerful people were trying to use the judiciary to gag the legislature to hinder the process of democracy. But he said the house was not intimidated by them. Dogara said they cannot gag the legislature as such the legislature cannot decide how the run. “We know that Nigeria is not Banana Republic and operates on basic principles such as rule of law and separation of power, which states that none of the arms of government should gag the other “Just as we cannot gag the judiciary, we also expect same from them. We make laws and the constitution only empower them to interpret the laws. “But for us to sit here and the judiciary tells us what we should consider and not consider and when to seat, then we are no longer practising democracy. “I don’t think it is us that is intimidating the judiciary like is being alleged. It is some people that are intimidating them from somewhere else, to gag the national assembly “We have respected the judiciary a lot and we expect same from them. When the judiciary gets to the level they are now, that spells danger for our democracy. If they insist they must continue this way, we have to part ways.” Do you have something awesome to share with the world?
