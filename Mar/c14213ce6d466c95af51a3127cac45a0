Ian Wright believes that Bayern Munich will turn their attention to Liverpool striker Roberto Firmino if they lose Robert Lewandowski this summer. Robert Lewandowski has been linked to Real Madrid over the past few seasons Wright believes that Bayern Munich will consider a swoop for Firmino, who has been in fine form for Jurgen Klopp at Anfield having netted 23 goals so far this season. “They are talking about Lewandowski to Real Madrid. If that happens Bayern want Bobby Firmino,” Wright told Sky Sports News. “Firmino is an excellent nine and a half. He is unbelievable.” The 26-year-old joined the Merseyside outfit from the Bundesliga after agreeing a move from Hoffenheim. Liverpool, under Brendan Rodgers at the time, signed the Brazilian for around £30m. However, he only started to flourish when played up front in Klopp’s system, alongside Sadio Mane and Mohamed Salah.
