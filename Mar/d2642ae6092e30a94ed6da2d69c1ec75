Aleksandar Mitrovic’s second-half brace was enough to secure a comfortable 2-0 win for Serbia against a disappointing Super Eagles of Nigeria in an international friendly played at the Hive Stadium in London on Tuesday night, March 27, 2018. Following their lone goal win over Poland in their last outing, the expectations were quite high that the Eagles could follow up with another win over Serbia. But that was not the case as the Serbians shook off their defeat against Morocco to beat Nigeria quite convincingly on Tuesday in London. Nigeria’s best chance fell to Victor Moses, as the Chelsea wing-back forced Vladimir Stojkovic into a smart save at the death. Aleksandar Mitrović was the hero as he hit the brace that ensured Serbia beat Nigeria 2-0. The defeat was only the second defeat of Gernot Rohr’s tenure, and the German tactician will surely have learned a lot from the performance of some of his peripheral players in their loss against the Eastern Europeans. Meanwhile, Serbia booked their spot in Russia for the first time since 2010 after a remarkable run of form in the qualifying stages.
