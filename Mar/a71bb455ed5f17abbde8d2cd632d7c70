Ethereum classic price tumbled sharply against the US Dollar and Bitcoin. ETC/USD is now trading well below $18.00 and it remains at a risk of more losses. There was no upside move above $21.00 during the past few days in ETC price against the US dollar. The price started a downside move and traded below the $20.00 handle. The downside move was strong as the price even failed to hold the $18.00 support level. It is now trading well below the $18.00 pivot level and the 100 hourly simple moving average. The recent low was formed at $15.66 and it seems like sellers are here to stay. If there is a correction, the price may face sellers near the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the last decline from the $21.73 high to $15.66 low. There is also a key connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $18.00 on the hourly chart of the ETC/USD pair. The same trend line is near the 38.2% Fib retracement level of the last decline from the $21.73 high to $15.66 low. Therefore, the $17.00 and $18.00 levels are seen as crucial barriers for buyers in the near term.  On the downside, the price could break the recent low of $15.66 and test $15.00. The overall bias is bearish on BTC, ETH, XRP and all major cryptocurrencies. Hourly MACD – The MACD for ETC/USD is not showing any signs of a recovery.
