A human rights lawyer Maxwell Opara says the Nigerian army might just be keeping the whereabouts of IPOB leader Nnamdi Kanu secret as he is convinced they (military) are holding on to him. Barrister Opara queried the invasion of the house of the IPOB leader by the army, during the time all parties were waiting to hear bail application outcomes for the embattled IPOB leader. Addressing a press conference yesterday in Abuja, Opara said; “When the government of the Federal Republic of Nigeria said that Nnamdi Kanu violated his bail conditions which is normal, yes they have the right to say it. They went further to apply for summons asking the court to revoke the bail of Nnamdi Kanu. “While we are waiting to hear their application on the 7th of October, 2017, the military went to his house on the 11th September with an armored car and besieged the place and people were asking why, why? Why should that happen? “They left only for them to come back on the 14th September 2017 and killed every living thing in that house- dog, fowl, lizard, human being- everything they killed, 28 persons were killed and they left with their copses. I am talking about the Nigerian Army. Since then, we have not heard of Nnamdi Kanu. “It is a very simple thing. Why are we being naïve? Why are Nigerians behaving like this? Even the journalists are not helping matters. Nobody has gone to ask the Chief of Army Staff or Director of Military Intelligence or the Army Public Relations Officer, why should they bring armoured car to his compound?” he queried.
