Same day, same dude, pretty much the same modus operandi. Following yesterday’s article, which featured CCTV footage of a thief targeting a RocoMamas patron, today we have another. This time, CCTV footage from a what appears to be a different restaurant shows a diner sitting on his cellphone, when a man in a white t-shirt enters the area. Again on his cellphone, again acting all innocent – the thief mills around until, BAM, he makes his move and sprints off with the patron’s cellphone. If you look closely enough, it appears he enters a similar getaway car to the one we saw yesterday. The incident, which also took place on February 27, can be seen below:  So this one took place at just after 1PM, and the video we saw yesterday took place at 1:18PM – no rest for the wicked. Let’s just hope that this type of robbery is shut down before other start emulating the thief. [source:timeslive] Do you have something awesome to share with the world?
