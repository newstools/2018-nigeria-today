OK, but he is our thug so it’s kinda tough to hate him. Much like how many Ozzies love David Warner, even though he is a poison dwarf, so to do Bok fans have a soft spot for Bakkies Botha. We know he was never too far away from a yellow card, and he loved to get stuck in physically, so there is no shortage of video compilations on YouTube to choose from. The latest is titled “Bakkies Botha – Rugby’s Biggest Thug”, and whoever compiled the video clearly wasn’t a fan: That’s not even close to his full rap sheet, buddy, but let’s enjoy The Enforcer in action:  Now that he has hung his boots up for good, Bakkies seems to be enjoying Twitter. Over the weekend he offered his support to KG Rabada and the Proteas, who will later today have his appeal against a two-match suspension heard.  Seeing as though Steve Smith went scampering to the umpire after Rabada’s sleeve brushed his, I don’t reckon he would fare too well against Bakkies.
