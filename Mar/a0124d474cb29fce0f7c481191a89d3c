Senator Ali Ndume from Borno state has warned his colleagues in the National Assembly not to thwart President Muhammadu Buhari’s decline of the recently amended electoral bill by the National Assembly. According to him, such efforts will not be in the interest of the masses of the country which they represent. It would be recalled that President Buhari yesterday declined accent to the amended electoral bill passed by the National Assembly, which saw it re-order the sequence of the 2019 general elections. The President in his decline letter to the lawmakers had cited usurping the powers of the Independent National Electoral Commission INEC as a major reason for his decline. Although the National Assembly with a two third majority can over- ride the president’s veto on any bill. Ndume while making reference to his fellow lawmakers said; “If they make any move to override the president, we will block them. We are over 43 and more persons have indicated interest today. We are calling on our colleagues not to push the issue further because it is not in public interest.” He reasoned that if the elections are conducted twice, the security implications would be less than when it is spread to three weeks as proposed by the bill.  .
