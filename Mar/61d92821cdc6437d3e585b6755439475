Former Vice-President, Atiku Abubakar has promises to give 40 percent of appointments in his cabinet to the youth if they help him wins the 2019 presidential election. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Atiku made the promise at the inauguration of the national and state executives of a group loyal to him, Intellectual Think-Tank for Atiku (ITTA), in Abuja. Atiku, who was represented at the event by Oladimeji Fabiyi, chairman of All Atiku Support Group (AASUG), said the 40 percent representation is because of the “critical role” the youth play in elections. “Having identified the critical role of youths in the emergence of any leader, I pledge to give youths 40 percent of appointments in my cabinet if elected as the president of Nigeria in 2019 “As a youth-friendly leader who thinks and understands the feelings of youth, I urge them to give me the chance to make their dreams possible.” He said. Nigeria Today sources gathered that the failure of Buhari to get second term endorsement from the Summit of Northern Groups, held at Arewa House, Kaduna, on Saturday, 24th March, 2018 is not only due to the Fulani herdsmen crisis but the current yearning for change of government in the country due to Buhari mismanagement of the economy. The source stated that Northern elite are very keen at retaining the presidency in 2019, but they are not so sure whether the Tinubu- Buhari coalition will give them that victory again, currently they are considering throwing their support on Atiku Abubakar according to the source, but they are afraid of doing so openly because they are afraid of what may befall them if Buhari discover their plot.
