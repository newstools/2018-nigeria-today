Could Elon Musk’s efforts have inspired a whole new generation of children to adopt “build space rockets!” as their answer to “what would you like to do when you grow up”? We can only hope so. When SpaceX’s Falcon Heavy lifted off on February 6 this year, it became the most powerful operational rocket in the world by a factor of two, with the ability to lift nearly 64 metric tonnes into orbit . In simple terms, that means that: If you had your head in the sand and totally missed what happened, you can see highlights of the launch here. Famously, Falcon Heavy’s payload was a Tesla Roadster and passenger, Starman, and the rocket placed the duo into orbit around the sun. However, signal to the payload was soon lost, and now all we have is this assumption of where they are. Over the weekend, to pay homage to the historical day, Musk’s team released a recap of the events set to none other than David Bowie’s “Starman”. I really hope you get the reference by now. Encapsulating SpaceX’s milestone in a short amount of time, it was made together with the Westworld creators. It arrived soon after Musk made a guest appearance at the SXSW 2018 Westworld panel, reports Engadget: Ready to shed a tear? It even features some never-before-seen footage:  Honestly, I got a little emotional there, if only because of all the clips of children looking super stoked about what had just happened.
