Theoretically one of the best upcoming producer/singer hailing from Lagos. Drexbeats is back with a new trap tune after recently dropping Ileke. The song has a very catchy and fluid tune filled with mood and reckoning. For your Love is only trying to explain how a love sweet turned sour and how a beautiful heart ended in turbulence, giving details of what went wrong.
