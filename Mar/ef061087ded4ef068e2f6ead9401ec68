With great power comes great responsibility, or so they say. While that responsibility is supposed to extend to every aspect of the job, Western Cape traffic officials aren’t practicing it when it comes to handling potential arrestees. I mean, such treatment is unfortunately nothing new, but this time it was caught on camera. On Monday, shortly after Zainodien Allie was arrested, News24 reports that traffic officials allegedly told him that: I mean, that’s a bit excessive, no? After all, he didn’t really do anything: The video below, posted by his daughter, Bashiera Allie, online, shows what the arrest looked – and sounded – like:  According to Allie, the officers arrested him without informing him of his rights and took him to Lansdowne police station: Luckily, Allie didn’t spend the night with the murderers and the rapists. He was released the same day after his family came to rescue him:  Now, Mayoral Committee Member for Safety and Security JP Smith said an “investigation into the incident was launched and that other officers had a different version”: However, Smith did add that violent behaviour from staff members was not tolerated and if they are found guilty, action will be taken. Does that mean they end up spending a night with the murderers and the rapists? Highly doubt it. [source:news24] Do you have something awesome to share with the world?
