The Federal Government says its Whistle Blower policy has so far led to the recovery N7.8 billion, $378 million and £27,800 stolen from public treasury.
So said Kemi Adeosun, minister of finance,  at a briefing with State House correspondents on Wednesday, after the weekly Federal Executive Council (FEC) meeting presided over by President Muhammadu Buhari.
“I also briefed on the number of tips we have had, the number of investigations we have dealt with, the types of monies that have been recovered through the whistleblower policy,” Adeosun said.
She announced that the Federal Government has collaborated with the government of the United Kingdom providing training on whistle blowing, on how Nigeria can institutionalise the policy, which she said, has come to stay.
“One of the things it has achieved is prevention. When they get the tips, they use it to block avenues for leakage. We have had a significant number tips.
“So, we will be coming back to institutionalise whistle blowing as a structure. It has  a central part of fighting corruption, giving us valuable information. Basically, whistle blowing is here to stay.”
On the 2017 budget, she put the capital releases till date from 2017 at N1.248,310 trillion.
So far, Power, Works and Housing got N301.89 billion, Defence N151.2 billion, Agriculture N119.9 billion, Transport N127.9 billion and others combined, got N545.6 billion.
Adeosun revealed that the Federal Government saved  N68 billion on personnel cost in 2017.
This brings the aggregate savings by the government on personnel cost since 2007 to date to N288 billion.
The FEC meeting was presided over by  President Muhammadu Buhari.
The savings, Adeosun explained, were funds that would have otherwise gone unaccounted for, which, she added, were now free for the government to fund capital projects.
She said the savings were achieved despite increases in personnel, including the employment of 10,000 by the Nigeria Police Force.
