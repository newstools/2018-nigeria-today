Gernot Rohr says it is only logical to snub Dele Alampasu and Dele Ajiboye for Francis Uzoho and Daniel Akpeyi. The two more experienced goalies were dropped, with Deportivo La Coruna youngster, Uzoho joining Akpeyi and Ezenwa for the pre-World Cup friendlies against Poland and Serbia in March. Rohr was asked why he snubbed Ajiboye and Alampasu, and he revealed Ajiboye was snubbed for Ezenwa, as he played second fiddle to the Enyimba man in the CHAN eagles, deputising between the sticks after he was injured. On Alampasu, he was blunt, insisting he cannot pick a goalkeeper that has not seen playing time. “They had already their chance, remember that we invited Dele [Ajiboye]. Dele is no. 2 in CHAN team and it’d be surprising that he is no. 1 and Ezenwa no. 2 in the Super Eagles,” Rohr said. “We must be logical in our choices and Dele Alampasu, unfortunately, is never playing. You cannot take a goalkeeper who is never playing!” “Uzoho made his debut for Nigeria against Argentina and did very well. He plays for the second team of La Coruna; we could see him,” Rohr continued. “So we see Ezenwa was injured but he is returning gradually and he played with the second team at his club already so we will see who would be the fittest one but I think Francis Uzohi who did so well in the second half against Argentina could add some more competition with us.” The post Rohr Reveals Reason Behind Ajiboye And Alampasu Snub appeared first on 360Nobs.com.
