The People’s Democratic Party PDP, says it is unfortunate that all the economic gains of the PDP years have been destroyed, by the All Progressives Congress APC and the nation is now placed on auto-pilot. National Publicity Secretary of the party Kola Ologbondiyan in a press statement yesterday said the situation under the APC has become so pathetic that the world is now contemplating on how to help Nigeria. “It is imperative to further state that our apology has to do more with the fact that we made certain mistakes that allowed an anti-people movement to take over governance in our country. “Our situation under the APC has become so pathetic that the world is now contemplating on how to help us. Under the APC misrule, the average life span of Nigerians has become abysmally low, purchasing power is eroded, the middle class has been wiped off, security is almost non-existent, all the economic gains of the PDP years have been destroyed, and our nation is now placed on auto-pilot. ‎”Therefore, our apology is to ask Nigerians, once again, to put their trust in the re-branded PDP, particularly, as our party is the only platform that is committed to the national agenda of peace, unity, justice and prosperous nation,” the PDP said.
