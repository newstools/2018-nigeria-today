Vocal Power House & Songwriter “Byno” who is currently receiving massive love & reviews from his recently released Visuals to his Single “Adanma” decided to jump on Adekunle Gold’s Stellar Number “Ire”… The Singer comes creative by adding some new Lyrics & also renders an R&B approach which is sure worth a Listen. A catchy line coined out from this cover is as thus “Even the Sugar u see, could be Ajinomoto”. Enjoy. https://www.360nobs.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Byno-Ire-A.G-Cover.mp3 &NBSP; Note: There is a file embedded within this post, please visit this post to download the file.
