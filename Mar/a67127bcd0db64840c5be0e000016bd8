The Deputy President of the Senate Ike Ekweremadu has reacted to the Federal Government’s order for him to forfeit his undeclared assets to the Code of Conduct Bureau CCB. The FG through the Special Presidential Investigation Panel for the Recovery of Public Property had asked the Federal High Court in Abuja to freeze assets linked to Ekweremadu. The Special Adviser (Media), to the DSP Mr Uche Anichukwu, in a statement issued on behalf of the Senator said the FG’s claims were false. “The attention of the Office of the Deputy President of the Senate, Sen. Ike Ekweremadu, has been drawn to a Motion Exparte filed by Festus Keyamo Chambers on behalf of the Special Presidential Investigation Panel for the Recovery of Public Property. “The motion is for an order to temporarily forfeit assets it claimed the senator did not declare with the Code of Conduct Bureau (CCB). “The so-called panel sought and obtained his Assets Declaration Forms, but could not look at them since it is clearly out on a vendetta and smear campaign. “Again, Sen. Ekweremadu wishes to assure all his supporters and well-wishers that there is nothing to worry about,” the statement said.  Do you have something awesome to share with the world?
