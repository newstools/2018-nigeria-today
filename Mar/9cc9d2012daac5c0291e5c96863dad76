Speaking in Rivers State where he sought the support of Governor Nyesom Wike, Atiku Said: “We all know what we have gone through in this country in the last three years. I can tell you throughout the whole of today that where the APC left us in the last three years whether in the education sector, health, or in the economy, we have been going down in every statistics. That is why I have offered myself to run for the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria in 2019 “Since  2015, we have not seen a 100 kilometres of road constructed by the APC Federal Government anywhere in the country. I have never seen Nigeria so divided along religious, ethnic and regional lines as a result of the mismanagement of the APC,” According to Vanguard , Atiku said he is offering himself to set the country on the path of growth, after the serial  failure of the APC. He stated that since 2015, the APC-led Federal Government has destroyed the education, health and infrastructural sectors through poor budgetary allocations and releases. The former vice president was accompanied by former Ogun State Governor, Otunba Gbenga Daniel, former Enugu State Governor and National Chairman of the PDP, Dr Okwesilieze Nwodo, former Attorney General of the Federation, Michael Aondoakaa and Senator Abdul Ningi.
