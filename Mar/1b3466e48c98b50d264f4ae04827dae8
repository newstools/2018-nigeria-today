A former running mate to President Muhammadu Buhari has warned the Federal Government that Nigerians were capable of shutting down the present government in the face of rising insecurity in the land. Pastor Tunde Bakare of the Latter Rain Assembly while speaking at an event organised by Enough is Enough, a coalition of youth advocacy groups in Lagos also said Nigerians need to wake up and put their own destinies into their hands. “This is why I said this government is compromised completely. If you are making such a rule, let it be a statute of general application, let it apply to all. “Nigerians need to wake up, shine their eyes and put their own destinies into their hands. They should fight for themselves. “There are several ways to do it. Civil unrest is one of them, protest is another. We (Nigerians) can shut this government down. “We have the numbers and we will show them that we have done it before and we will do it again.” Bakare called on the present administration to tackle corruption head long and desist from acts inimical to the economic growth of the country.
