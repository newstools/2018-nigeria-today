Speaking further, he disclosed that he has gone far in the assignment and will give the president a progress report on the task soon. The statement reads: “The assignment given to Asiwaju by President Muhammadu Buhari to lead the consultation, reconciliation and confidence-building efforts within the party is ongoing. He has gone so far in that assignment; as a matter of fact, he is about putting together an interim report for submission to the President. I’m not aware that it was slated to be done yesterday. “And I have also heard him say that this job was given to him by Mr. President and only Mr. President he will give the progress report. I think it is only right that you grant him that indulgence that he should be able to tell the President who gave him the assignment how far he has gone with that assignment.” Do you have something awesome to share with the world?
