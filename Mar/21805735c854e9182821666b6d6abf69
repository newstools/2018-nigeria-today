BY ROTIMI AGBANA Fast rising Nollywood actress, Winnie Lazarus, has shared her reservations about the third edition of Big Brother Naija reality show currently ongoing in South Africa. In an exclusive chat with Potpourri, the ‘Dangerous Act’ actress said since the show started it has been all about sex and other unacceptable immoral acts displayed by the housemates who have been shameless about it, a reason she has not been paying much attention to it. “It is not interesting like the previous ones, so I’m not paying too much attention to it. Only what I’m seeing is just sex, kiss and romance, so there’s a big difference from this edition and previous ones”, she lamented. She added that the organisers should introduce more beneficial twists to activities in the Big Brother house and quit promoting sex. “Sex is not the only thing we want. We need to see people with talent; we want to see different things there. Only making out with each other is what they give us as if that is the only thing we want from them. Yes, sex sells, but it is not the same for everybody”, she concluded. The post BBNAIJA: Sex! sex! sex, makes it boring – Actress, Winnie Lazarus appeared first on Vanguard News.
