Manchester United midfielder Tosin Kehinde seems to have chosen to represent the Nigeria national team. Tosin Kehinde, 19, was born in Lagos but is eligible to play for England. However, Kehinde was photographed shaking hands with Nigeria coach Gernot Rohr ahead of their London friendly with Serbia on Tuesday night. Kehinde expressed his gratitude to his Nigerian supporters last month and felt confident he was close to making his United senior debut. “It feels good to have that kind of support back home,” he said. “I’ve come close on occasion. All I need to do is continue to work hard. “Of course I’d be elated to play at the World Cup. It’s every footballers dream. Playing at any level for Nigeria would bring me pride. But I believe in myself enough to know I can bring something great to the Super Eagles first team.” Kehinde trained with the United first-team earlier this season and has started 15 times for the Under-23s in the Premier League 2. His strike at Chelsea in September was nominated for the club’s goal of the month competition.
