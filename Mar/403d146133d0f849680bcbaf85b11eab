 Most people that follow a diet plan do it the wrong way. They either lack the knowledge to properly structure a diet plan or make the diet plan unnecessarily hard. Following a diet plan should be helpful in reaching your goal, not a hindrance. I’m generally not a big believer in “one size fits all” diet plans, as diet plans work best when customized. This is because there are plenty of variables that need to be considered when structuring a diet plan. These variables include: age, gender, physical activity level, goals such as weight loss, maintenance or muscle build up, food preference or distaste. All these factors can heavily affect a diet plan. The best diet plan is the diet plan that works for you–one plan that suits your goals and is structured in a sustainable way. Therefore, the following diet plan is not intended to be followed strictly. Keep the meals and ideas that you like and disregard the other ones. Individualize the plan by yourself using apps such as MyFitnessPal or with the help of a knowledgeable friend or coach. But let’s first address the basics: I know a young woman with a meal plan that consists of bland noodles, literally. The only food that this person eats is noodles. Therefore noodles are on her dining table nearly 365 days a year. This is incredibly unhealthy for obvious reasons. One food alone doesn’t provide you with the necessary nutrients to sustain a healthy existence. The reason she’s eating only one food and isn’t looking to change anytime soon is because noodles are the only food that she likes. This is what the nutrition industry doesn’t want you to know: your taste buds can change. Taste is extremely variable. Have you ever eaten a food, hated it, but after continuous exposure to the thing you’ve become accustomed to it? Maybe you even started to like it? This happened to me multiple times. I just recently started eliminating added salt out of my diet. In the first week every food tasted completely bland. But after 2 weeks, unsalted food tasted completely normal as though it had been seasoned with salt just seconds before. The truth is, that you can’t listen to your body these days when it comes to your food intake. The nutrition industry is making you addicted to its products by using artificial sweeteners, aromas and colors. The healthiest foods are the ones that you can find in the produce aisle. But remember that healthy is always relative. I remember talking to my mother a couple of years ago. Back then I used to eat McDonalds; after one time I had eaten there I realized that I was not performing at my usual level. This was also the time when I was usually eating about 1 kilogram of meat every single day. Back then I thought that my diet plan was ‘healthy’. I didn’t realize that there was plenty of room for optimization. Now I know that healthy is always relative. A pack of donuts is healthy when the alternative is pure sugar. Pancakes are healthy if the alternatives are donuts. Whole grain vegan pancakes are healthy if the alternative is traditional pancakes. Healthy is relative. The healthiest diet plan for you is the one that fits these two premises: A couple of my friends tank their cars with premium gasoline, yet don’t pay attention for a single minute to the foods they put in their bodies. Their flats where they choose to live in are decorated by designers. Yet they don’t take care of the place where they necessarily have to live in: their bodies. Your body is renewing itself every 7-10 years. This is pretty astounding. A couple trillions of cells get replaced in that period. And where does your body get the building blocks from? Your diet. You have to set your priorities straight. Don’t be penny wise and pound foolish. This plan is suited to reach an average goal of about 2,000 calories per day (1942cal to be exact). This is the ideal calorie intake of an average women, or for an average man who is looking to lose weight (500 calorie deficit per day, resulting in about 0.5kg weight loss per week). The amount of fiber is around 50grams, which is nearly double the amount of the minimum daily intake and three times the amount in the average american diet.[1] This means that the meal plan is extremely healthy in comparison to what you’ll find on the market. You might feel a big increase in your energy. This meal plan is ideally for people who want to start eating a vegan diet. The meals are diverse, so you’re able to see the full range of what you can expect on a vegan diet. Note:  This plan is not meant to be followed 100%. Take all the positive things that you want from this plan and eliminate the negative ones. If you want to have a fully customized plan, you can visit my website (Hint: There’s a free gift for you). Important: Drink 3-4 liters of water every day and add green tea / coffee to your diet, as these are antioxidant-rich and healthy beverages.
