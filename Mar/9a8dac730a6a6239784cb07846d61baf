Julen Lopetegui says Bayern Munich defender, Javi Martinez who did not make the squad for the friendlies, still has a chance. Fabregas and Morata were also dropped from the squad to play Germany and Argentina. The last time Martinez featured for La Roja was in 2014, and Lopetegui insists he is in the mix. “Javi has been called many times by us, some other times he got injured just before coming,” the Spain coach said on Thursday. “He is in our mind, although has not been called now just for some details. “Of course he has many chances [to be picked for the World Cup] and will be back with us for sure. “We know him well, so he is one of our guys.” The post Lopetegui: Martinez Still Has World Cup Chance appeared first on 360Nobs.com.
