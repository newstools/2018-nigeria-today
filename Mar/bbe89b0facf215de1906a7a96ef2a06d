President Muhammadu Buhari yesterday reiterated his commitment to ending the insurgency in Nigeria’s North East by using the might of the Nigerian military to crush the insurgents. The President while addressing parents of the abducted Dapchi school girls in Yobe state also said much has been achieved in the fight against the terror group as the group has now resorted to brainwashing of little children to commit suicide bombing in mosques, churches and other public places. “We’ll not spare Boko Haram. We’ll use our military might to crush them and provide a lasting peace in the country. We have deployed police, including those in plain clothes, soldiers, Army, Navy and Air Force and other security operatives to continue searching until they rescue our children in good health,” he said. Buhari said he was in the state to express his sincere sympathy with the parents, government and all the people of Yobe whose daughters were abducted by the un-repented terrorists. “I want to reiterate our resolve to negotiate for the unconditional release of the girls,” he said.
