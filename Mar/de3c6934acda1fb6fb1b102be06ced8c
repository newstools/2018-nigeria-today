Professor Itse Sagay, Chairman of the Presidential Advisory Committee Against Corruption has threatened to reveal the ‘real’ take home package of Senate President Bukola Saraki, House of Reps Speaker Yakubu Dogara as well as other principal members of the National Assembly. Sagay in an interview with journalists over the weekend said Nigerians would be shocked the real take home package of principal officers of the national assembly as what is currently in public domain was their salaries which the Revenue Mobilisation Allocation and Fiscal Commission approved for them. “There are many things the press doesn’t know yet. If you come to know the allowances that the leadership of the two houses are getting. “My God! It will blow up the country. What is the Senate President getting? It is not the ordinary N13m. “What does he get as Senate President? What is the leader of the House getting, what is the deputy leader of the House getting? “What is the Deputy Senate President getting? What are the minority leaders getting in both houses? Go and find out. It is an explosive stuff, I tell you. “Eventually, I will come out with the figures. I am working on them now. When I am ready, I will come out with them,” he said. He said although the salary details released by the lawmakers was just about N700, 000, what they receive was twenty times more than that. “The salary details released was just about N700, 000 but what they voted for themselves is about 20 times that amount. That is the whole point and they were hiding it. “I came out with the figures last year and they wanted to cut off my neck and now it has come out in the open and Sabi Abdullahi is saying it is nothing new but you were denying it in the past,’ he said.
