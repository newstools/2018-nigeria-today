Sunflower oil is type of oil with non-volatile properties that is extracted from sunflowers. Sunflowers are popular flowers used mostly for aesthetic purposes but most people do not realize that they are a great source of healthy vegetable oil. Here are some important benefits of sunflower oil. Sunflower oil has a healthy balance of fatty acids and linoleic acid (an omega-6 fatty acid) which is very good for the body. Although omega-6 fatty acids are tagged as “bad” cholesterol most times, they are still essential to the body. Sunflower oil’s ability to find a balance between good and bad cholesterol makes it unique compared to other oils. It also doesn’t contain saturated fats which gives it the ability to reduce the overall cholesterol in the body. Its high vitamin E content makes it act as a natural antioxidant for the body. As such it’s been directly connected to preventing heart disease and boosting the immune system. Also because of its vitamin E, the oil is directly related with improving skin health and regenerating cells. This translates that the skin is better protected against damage from the sun, as well as the natural degradation of age that occurs when free radicals are present in the body. Vitamin E also neutralizes free radicals, keeping them from destroying or damaging healthy cells. Saturated fats tend to make the body feel weak, while unsaturated fats– which sunflower oil has an abundance of—keeps the body feeling energized.
