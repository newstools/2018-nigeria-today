The recently sacked chairman of Bokkos Local Government Area of Plateau State, Mr. Simon Angyol has cried out saying he is only being used as a scape goat by the governor Simon Lalong, as he was not in any way responsible for the recent killings in his local government. It would be recalled that the governor sacked the chairman yesterday over the persistent killings in Bokkos LGA with the most recent leaving about 25 people dead. But in a swift reaction to his sack, Mr. Angyol said many parts of Plateau such as Bassa, Jos South, Riyom and Barkin-Ladi are also facing the same challenge and expressed surprise why he was singled out. “To the best of my knowledge, no local government chairman has been blamed for the violence in their areas. Why should my local government be singled out? “I am only a victim of circumstances because no one has ever called me to find out what happened here, or even told me where I went wrong to warrant my removal. “I am not desperate for that position. I leave everything to God,” he said.  Do you have something awesome to share with the world? Click here to share Do you ever have any question about anything you wish to ask and get answer?
