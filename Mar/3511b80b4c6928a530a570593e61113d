Just the other day, the verbal abuse that reportedly came from a policeman went something along the lines of ” I’ll put [you] in the cells with the murderers and the rapists”, but this time the retort was a little more personal. More than a month ago, on February 5, Prudence Hansen was arrested at Canal Walk in Cape Town when she and a colleague, Russel Dirks, were smoking in a stairwell near to where they worked, reports News24. Hansen explained that the situation was sparked when one of the officers shouted: “Move there, move!”: Once she was in the van, she started kicking the officer: The 27-year-old tried to free her wrist from his grip, but then the police officer pulled her by her hoodie, she alleged. She claimed she was also choked: It was at this moment that Dirks began to film the incident:  During the incident, a police officer allegedly told Hansen: Last week, the video of her arrest has widely circulated on social media, and has now been shared more than 10 000 times: Set to appear in court on February 7, the case was dropped: So she opened a case against the officer instead, and has since lost her job. However, she did not want the police officer to lose his job, she said: I understand that policemen must deal with a lot of lip every day of their lives, but it’s really time to grow up and deal with situations with a level of calm that transcends the circumstances.
