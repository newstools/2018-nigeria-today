If Friday night’s match between England and Holland has taught us anything, it’s that the World Cup in Russia this June is going to be a bloodbath. 5 234 official England Supporters Club ticket holders travelled for Friday night’s friendly (yeah, sure) at the Amsterdam Arena, but the match was marred by violence both before and after kick-off. All told more than 100 English fans were arrested, with 90 on Friday alone. Before we get to footage of the hooligans in action, here’s BBC Sport: That they most certainly were…   This additional footage shows the general recklessness:  And of course there was footage of some of these ‘lads’ popping in to visit a lady friend:  According to National Police Chiefs’ Council (NPCC) deputy chief constable Mark Roberts, who spoke to Sky News, the behaviour of the English fans is indicative of a worrying trend: It’s sad that a police deputy chief has to argue that such a match shouldn’t be played on a Friday night, because a bunch of grown men cannot be trusted to show a sniff of common sense and decency. Security forces at this year’s World Cup need to be ready for out and out war. [sources:bbcsport&skynews] Do you have something awesome to share with the world?
