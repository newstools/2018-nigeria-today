The last time we featured Ryan Sandes, he had just done something remarkable. He had finally won the Western States Endurance Race, a gruelling 160 kilometre cross-country race, and that feat warranted a closer look at the work that went on behind the scenes. This time around – well, of course he’s gone and done something else that again defies logic. Together with Ryno Griesel, the pair set a new fastest-known time along the 1 406 kilometre Great Himalayan Trail. The duo finished the route a full four days faster than the previous 28-day record, set by fellow South African Andrew Porter, and clocked an incredible time of 24 days‚ 14 hours and 47 minutes. That’s around 57 kilometres per full day, or an ultramarathon at altitudes that make breathing tough, whilst battling “life-threatening chest spasms and frostbite”. With his name once again up in lights, CNN did an interview with one of Hout Bay’s finest:  Who knows, maybe you’ll run a half marathon and realise you’re some kind of endurance freak. Here’s more on the Great Himalayan Trail feat via Times LIVE: I suppose on a run like that you either become mates or you end up killing each other, and thankfully it was the former. Superb work, gents. [sources:cnn&timeslive] Do you have something awesome to share with the world? Click here to share Do you ever have any question about anything you wish to ask and get answer?
