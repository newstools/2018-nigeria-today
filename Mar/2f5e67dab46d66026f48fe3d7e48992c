There has been a major twist at the  ongoing Big Brother Naija 2018 tagged double wahala as Big Brother is set to bring back two evicted housemates into the show. According the host, Ebuka, viewers will vote starting on Monday for two evicted housemates they wish to bring back into the house. A statement by the show organizers read:  The Wahala In a twist like no other this season, Big Brother has decided to put the power in your hands. At the end of the Sunday Eviction show, Ebuka announced that this week the public will be voting to bring back two of their favourite Housemates. Yes, that’s right, this week you will have the opportunity to Vote to bring two Housemates back into the Big Brother game this season. The eligible Housemates are Anto, Leo, IfuEnnada, Ahneeka, Angel, Princess, Bitto, Vandora, Dee-One, Khloe and K.Brule. They Just Don’t Know The Housemates will continue with Nominations as normal on Monday evening, but they will be null and void. Of course, this is a little detail that they will not know until next week. Instead of saying “Goodbye!” to a current Housemate, they will be saying “Hello again!” to two ex-Housemates who will be joining them in the quest towards the 45 million Naira. Double Chances – Double Wahala The two Housemates that make it back into the House next week will be returning as individuals, and not as their original pairs. This means you will be Voting for an individual Housemate, and not a pair. The returning Housemates will remain in the House until they are Voted out according to the normal proceedings of the season. They will take part in all House activities, Nominations and Tasks as well. This twist has been seen on international Big Brother seasons like the U.S and Canada, but this is a first for the African continent! Make sure you have registered to Vote this week, as it’s going to be a big one. Voting will open immediately after the Nomination show on Monday evening. https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js But the news did not go down well with viewers as many interpreted it as a bad move.
