Well, at least we know he’s still passionate about the game. Over the weekend Bismarck du Plessis’ Montpellier took on Racing 92, and we have become accustomed to seeing the hooker getting stuck into the opposition. He was involved in a decent scrap back in December, but this time around it was all a little too close to home. Before kick-off he tussled with 127 kilogram prop and teammate Mohamed Haouas, and it looks like Mo lands a pretty decent shot to the kisser. The pair were pulled apart before more damage could occur, and Montpellier went on to a resounding 41-3 victory. Still, not a good look:  Maybe the prop was mocking that advert Bismarck starred in? We’ll give them a solid six for drama, but it doesn’t rival the amazing mid-match Lee Bowyer – Kieron Dyer Newcastle bust-up from back in 2005:  Never a dull moment with the Toon.
