The son of the late Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi will stand as a candidate in the presidential election expected to take place in mid-2018, a spokesman for the family has confirmed. “There is no doubt that Saif Al-Islam will run for Libya’s president,” Bassem Al-Sol insisted. “It is an inevitable move.” The man in charge of the potential candidate’s political reform programme, Ayman Boras, will announce Gaddafi’s presidential bid, said Al-Sol. An African news agency reported earlier that Boras was set to hold a press conference in Tunisia on Monday to highlight the details of Gaddafi’s reform programme. “Saif Al-Islam Gaddafi enjoys the support of major tribes in Libya,” Al-Sol added. Speaking at a press conference, his presentation included Gaddafi’s vision for the mechanisms to implement comprehensive national reconciliation in Libya and tackle the country’s crises.  __________ Follow us on Twitter at @thesignalng Copyright 2018 SIGNAL.
