By Agberebi James: Super Eagles skipper John Mikel Obi has congratulated his teammates following their 1-0 win against Poland in Friday’s international friendly in Wroclaw. Chelsea forward Victor Moses was the hero for the Eagles as he converted a 61st minute penalty to give the Eagles the hard-fought win. Despite playing most part of the game on the back foot, the Eagles were still able to contain the Poles who had Bayern Munich striker Robert Lewandowski in action. Reacting to the win, Mikel who was not in Poland for the friendly due to work permit issues, also hailed Moses for calmly putting away his penalty.  “Cool finish from the spot from Victor Moses! Great win for the team,” Mikel wrote on his Twitter handle. The Eagles will travel to London to take on Serbia on Tuesday for their second friendly game.
