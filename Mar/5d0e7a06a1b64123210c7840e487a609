It was trouble stirred by ex housemates,  as Khloe and Anto re-entered the Big Brother Naija  House. The duo’s re-entry on Sunday’s live show follows a week long campaign for viewers to vote back two of their favourite evicted housemates, even as the other housemates came to terms with the fact that they had been pranked by Big Brother with respect to the week’s nominations. Sunday’s show kicked off with performances by Nigerian vocal powerhouse, Waje as she  sang her popular  song, I’m available’ and Indigenous Nigerian rapper, Zoro, who rendered a medley of ‘Bianca’ and his hit track ‘Ogene.’ Suspense began to mount after Ebuka told the housemates they had been saved from the fake evictions but nonetheless kept them in limbo regarding their fate in the Big Brother house. All the actions took place as viewers waited anxiously to know who would be returning to the house. The duo of Anto and Khloe were eventually announced as the returning housemates who would be getting a second shot at winning the coveted prize of N25 million, an SUV and other prizes totalling N45 million. A further twist emerged with Ebuka announcing that he would be partying inside the Big Brother House on Saturday alongside another special guest who remains unknown.
