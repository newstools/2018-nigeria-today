Senator Dino Melaye representing Kogi West senatorial District in the upper chambers of the National Assembly has reacted to the yesterday’s indicted by some armed thugs who said they were recruited by him to cause political crisis in the state. It would be recalled that the Nigeria Police yesterday paraded two thugs who claimed to be working for the senator, after he had given them cash and ammunitions to cause crisis in Kogi state ahead of the 2019 general elections. Reacting, Senator Melaye said the allegations were lies fabricated to blackmail him at all cost. “Fabricated lies by Kogi State Govt and the police will fail. It’s utterly laughable and preposterous. It’s a sign of desperation. “No amount of lies and blackmail will detract my attention from speaking the truth and defending it”, he said on his official Twitter handle.
