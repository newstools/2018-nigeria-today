The People Democratic party has cautioned Nigerian Military to steer clear of partisan politics in view of their comments on the submission of deputy senate president, Ike Ekweremadu during senate plenary. In a press statement signed by the party’s publicity secretary, Kola Ologbodiyan, the PDP advises the Nigerian army to maintain their high value and ethics and resist any desperate attempt by failed APC administration to dragged them into mud in a bid to criminalize every contrary view or attempt to call it to order. “The PDP holds the institution of the Nigerian military in high esteem and we advise that it should not allow itself to be dragged into desperate attempts by failed APC administration to criminalize every contrary view or attempt to call it to order. “Every student of Nigeria’s history knows that executive excuses such as sponsored political violence, intimidation of opposition and dissent voices, human right abuses, disrespect for court orders and disregard for the separation of powers and rule of law as we have today in Nigeria have always been the bane of the nations democracy. “Nigeria are aware of the numerous flagrant disobedience to court orders by the APC-led administration as well as harassment, arrest, detention and media trail of perceived political opponent of the government on the flimsiness trumped up charges, while established cases of corruption by the presidency cabal are swept under the carpet.” Do you have something awesome to share with the world?
