Former president, Olusegun Obasanjo who recently called on president Muhammadu Buhari not to seek second term on the basis of corruption, poor performance, among others had denied reports attributing to him that Nigeria will collapse if Buhari wins re-election. Speaking exclusively to Premium time from from Azerbaijan, Obasanjo stated that Nigeria is so strong and there will be nothing that will make Nigeria to collapse. He said if Nigeria survives Abacha’s regime, the country can survive anything. According to him ” My faith and conviction about Nigeria is so strong that I don’t see the country either being dismembered or collapsing. As far as I am concerned, the worst is over. What remains is for all of us and for our leadership to show good faith and commitment to do what is right. Then Nigeria will grow from strength to strength” “I won’t and can’t say that (that Nigeria will collapse if Buhari is re-elected). There will be nothing that will make Nigeria collapse. When Nigeria did not collapse under a civil war, it won’t collapse now. “I regard those as aberrations and they will pass away. Such aberrations will pass away with the regime that bring them. “Don’t forget that Abacha did more than that. Of course Abacha’s regime was not a democracy, it was a military dictatorship. If we survived that, then we will survive any shenanigan against democracy. That’s the greatest advantage of democracy.” Do you have something awesome to share with the world?
