The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) says it will go on with the process for the recall of the senator representing Kogi West senatorial district, Senator Dino Melaye from the national assembly in line with the judgement of the court of Appeal. INEC’s Director of Publicity and Voter Education, Mr Oluwole Osaze-Uzzi, disclosed this while speaking with Channels Television. “For now, all legal hurdles as far as we are aware have been removed so the commission should proceed as if the case did not occur.” He said. The court of Appeal on Friday in Abuja dismissed the appeal filed by Melaye against the judgment delivered by Justice Nnamdi Dimgba at the Federal High Court in 2017, saying Melaye’s complaints were ‘hasty, premature and presumptuous” then  ordered INEC to go ahead with the planned verification exercise of the 188,588 registered voters who were said to have signed a petition in support of the recall process. Meanwhile, Melaye has headed to Supreme court to challenge the decision of the court of Appeal. In a statement on his Twitter account, Melaye urged his supporters to be relaxed as though he walked through the valley of the shadow of death he will fear no evil, saying every lie has an expiry date and he is appealing the judgement immediately   Do you have something awesome to share with the world?
