“You must rise to protect yourselves from these people, if you depend on the Arm Forces to protect you, you will all die,” were the exact words of Nigeria’s former Minister for Defence, General Theophilus Danjuma. The retired general  gave the advise on Saturday at the convocation of the Taraba state University in Jalingo, Taraba state capital, following the incessant killings of Nigerians by fulani herdsmen. In his words; You must rise to protect yourselves from these people, if you depend on the Arm Forces to protect you, you will all die. “This ethnic creasing must stop in Taraba, and it must stop in Nigeria. These killers have been protected by the military, they cover them and you must be watchful to guide and protect yourselves because you have no any other place to go. “The ethnic cleansing must stop now otherwise Somalia will be a child play. “I ask all of you to be on your alert and defend your country, defend your state.”   Do you have something awesome to share with the world?
