A former minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Godsday Orubebe says the People Democratic Party has gone from the party of pride to a party of shame. Orubebe disclosed this in an open letter addressed to the PDP National Chairman, Prince Uche Secondus. In the letter, Orubebe lamented that the PDP was coming under the control of certain individuals, who were exhibiting dangerous levels of undemocratic behaviours and urged the party to embrace urged reforms in order not to become a shadow or a thing of the past. The letter reads in part: “The party is gradually coming under the control of certain individuals, who are exhibiting dangerous levels of undemocratic behaviors. “We have gone from a party of pride to a party of shame and gradually receding into the abyss of political reality. For the simple reason that the nation is witnessing calls for the rise of a ‘third force’, we are fast becoming a shadow of ourselves. “The party is gradually coming under the control of certain individuals, who are exhibiting dangerous levels of undemocratic behaviors. One of the biggest challenges that the PDP faces is balancing its needs for funding with established egalitarian values and internal systems. “If the party continues to be held hostage by few major donors, it will continue to find it difficult to instil the values that will endear us Nigerians. “We must take our appeal to Nigerians and through our reforms, let the party truly become a people-funded party. Small donations from millions of Nigerians will go a long way in the party’s financial requirements and will create the necessary atmosphere for true ownership among members of the party.” Do you have something awesome to share with the world?
