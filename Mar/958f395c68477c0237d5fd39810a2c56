If I wanted to make James Corden cry, I would show him this article from October of last year. Too lazy to click? OK, the headline is “So, You Don’t Like James Corden? A Guide for Americans”, with the tagline “We could have told you this ages ago, honestly”. There’s even a Facebook page – harsh. Oprah, however, decided to take a different approach. James issued her with a challenge during her The Late Late Show appearance, which was to see if the mogul could make him cry, and I think we all know how this one ends:  Let it out, man, let it out. You know what else Oprah is good at? Bathing:  Rub it in our Cape Town faces, why don’t you? [source:youtube] Do you have something awesome to share with the world?
