By Aniekut Akpan Yes! just like yesterday
the surface is still smooth
the edges cut out a little
Redesign to take the shape
rays of light struck
without penetration but reflected in another body
the mirror in human. The reflection stood still
taking the motion of the other
at a great wonder the body is
unable to fathom what has become
spring to the right and to the left
only to see the other manifest. Eyes to eyes they gaze
each sucking the energy from the other
priming themselves to win
there the naked is shown
not to frighten nor to chase
but to give on a self, only you could see before the world could see.
