Two weeks ago we told you about some mysterious footage filmed in Milwaukee, which had the live on-air anchors somewhat lost for words. That one was quickly debunked as being a flock of seagulls, but it’s a little tougher to explain away a new video doing the rounds. Let’s start from the beginning, though, which means explaining what the ‘The Stars Academy of Arts and Science’ is all about. Co-founded by former Blink-182 musician Tom DeLonge (you know those guys love aliens), the organisation aims to shine a light on the unexplained, picking up where the Pentagon left off when they shelved an initiative devoted to identifying unknown objects in aerospace. This is their video that caused the initial stir a few months back:  So there’s that video, and then there’s ‘Go Fast’, which they released late last week. CNN reports: Here’s the ‘Go Fast’ video that the Academy uploaded to YouTube:  And some of their write-up about the video: CNN Safety Analyst David Soucie is stumped: Hey, if he can’t explain it then what hope is there for us. For what it’s worth, Elizondo doesn’t believe that this is concrete evidence of aliens, but he still has questions that he wants answered: If it is aliens, may I suggest that they pack it in and return home at once. I’m not sure that there’s much to learn from the mess that we have made down here. [source:cnn] Do you have something awesome to share with the world?
