People Democratic Party has slammed president Muhammadu Buhari for his failure to control the Inspector-General of Police, Ibrahim Idris, saying he is not qualified to be in office. National Coordinator of Grassroots Development Initiative, GDI, a PDP group, Bright Amewhule stated this in Port Harcourt, yesterday while receiving some members of  All Progressives Congress, APC, who defected to PDP. According to Amewhule If the Inspector general of police disobeyed the order of the president to relocate to Benue State and the president has not done anything, it means that president Buhari was losing charge of the security chiefs. He said as the Chief Security Officer of the nation, Buhari ought to be in charge. But recent events have proved that Buhari does not seem to be in charge.  Amewhule advises Buhari to take the lives of Nigerians seriously because he swore an oath to do. “President Buhari is not qualified to be in office if he cannot control the Inspector General of Police. He asked the IGP to relocate to Benue State but he refused, it shows that he (Buhari ) is not in charge. “Every day we hear herdsmen killing innocent people and we have heard that the schoolgirls kidnapped in Dapchi are still in the hands of their abductors, it means the president is not serious with the security of lives and property of Nigerians. He should take the lives of Nigerians seriously.” Do you have something awesome to share with the world?
