The Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB) has disclosed that any candidate that cannot be identified through biometrics will be barred from writing the ongoing Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME). The board’s Head, Media and Information Department, Dr. Fabian Benjamin, disclosed this in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Sunday in Lagos. He said this against the backdrop of some reported cases in some centres where some candidates could not be identified through JAMB’s electronic system. Benjamin said the measure was to ensure the eligibility of candidates and reduce cases of impersonation.
