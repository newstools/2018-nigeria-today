The General Overseer of Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG), Paster Enoch Adeboye, on Friday paid a visit to Benue State to condole with the people over the deaths recorded during clashes between farmers and herdsmen. Speaking in Makurdi, the state capital, when he visited the State Governor, Samuel Ortom, in the company of Folu, his wife, Adeboye said he was moved to tears over the “mindless killings” of people in the state. Addressing the gathering before going into prayers, Pastor Adeboye explained that he did not visit the state much earlier before President Muhammamadu Buhari visited so as not to leave room for suspicion in the minds of politicians. Earlier, Governor Samuel Ortom had lamented that the incursions of herdsmen into the state, apart from leading to the deaths of many, had created a huge humanitarian crisis in the state. He appealed to the church to sustain prayers for the government and people of the state given the enormous challenge the crisis posed to the wellbeing of the people of the state.
