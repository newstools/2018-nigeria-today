Kampala, Uganda | THE INDEPENDENT | Former Security Minister, Henry Tumukunde used the funeral platform of former minister Matthew Rukikaire’s son in Rukungiri on Mar. 02 to praise his bush war comrade Dr.  KizzaBesigye. He said; “Besigye is out of government but he remains a very powerful man. What is more important is that he never uses this power to divide people… I think that is why we are friends. I have known you as a person who never sabotages development. I think that is why we are friends. I hope you can also be friends with your other powerful man (possibly referring to MrMuseveni). Also, let me state it here that if it wasn’t for you, Besigye, I would not have a leg.” Two days after he made these comments – March 04, he was dropped as Minister alongside his opponent, Kale Kayihura, the former Inspector General of Police. It is not clear whether these comments were the reason behind his sacking. The post THIS WEEK: When Tumukunde praised Besigye in Rukungiri appeared first on The Independent Uganda:.
