The Nigeria Police Force has debunked reports in some quarters that the Inspector General of Police Ibrahim Idris was queried by President Muhammadu Buhari over his refusal to relocate to Beue state, in the face of the recent killings by herdsmen in the state. It would be recalled that President Buhari had expressed shock during his last visit to the state that the IGP flouted his order of relocating to the state. “The IGP was not queried.
