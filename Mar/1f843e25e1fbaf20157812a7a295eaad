In the cutthroat environment of job searching, it’s often those who put in a little bit of extra effort that land the job. For example, take my one friend, a copywriter: he rewrote a company’s handbook. Another friend, a social media manager, turned a Facebook page into her CV. And there you thought you were clever. But then Chase Zreet took things one step further. Of all the things in the world, Zreet wanted to work on the Sprite account at Wieden+Kennedy, so he decided to do things differently. Instead of submitting a traditional cover letter, he submitted a three-minute music video rapping about his love for Sprite, reports Mashable: If you like Vince Staples, you’re going to love what Zreet has to offer:  New favourite song? Damn straight. A new standard for job applications? We wouldn’t go that far. It’s pretty obvious that not every job requires the applicant to be that creative, and not every company that’s creative wants the effort. So, if your CV is slightly more, err, serious, perhaps you should take a chance and submit it for one of ManpowerGroup SA’s listings. No matter what, be confident – you got this!
