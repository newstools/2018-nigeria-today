Widely acclaimed leader of the All progressive congress (APC), Bola Ahmed Tinubu has praised president Muhammdu Buhari for saving the party from serious legal turmoil. Buhari had in a national executive committee meeting of the APC kicked against the tenure elongation of incumbent chairman, John Oyegun. Tinubu who considers the elongation illegal, feels Buhari did the right thing. “The President declared that any such moves would contravene both the national and party constitutions,” he said in a statement. “While it would have been easy to allow the ill-conceived motion of 27 February to stand, President Buhari showed principle and courage by steering the party back to its original and correct path. “His action has saved the party from serious legal turmoil… such a predicament would constitute an unnecessary and mortal blow to the party and its role in promoting progressive governance to Nigeria. “Moreover, President Buhari has affirmed for all to see that our party is one based on the rule of law coupled with a firm adherence to internal democracy.”   Do you have something awesome to share with the world?
