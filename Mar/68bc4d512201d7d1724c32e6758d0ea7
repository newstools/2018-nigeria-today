It is no longer news that incumbent Kogi state governor Yahaya Bello and serving senator from Kogi West Dino Melaye are at daggers drawn. But what is news is the real reason behind the rift which was made public by the governor yesterday while being interviewed on telephone on a popular Channels TV program. According to Governor Bello, his inability to ‘share’ the lean resources of the state among politicians (Dino included) had pitched the Yagba West Senator against him. “We are aware of a particular senator who wants elephants to be shared in Kogi State and I refused. “The people of the state must have value for the lean resources that we are generating, and we are receiving; if that is his problem, so be it,” the governor said. On the recent attack on Senator Ahmed Ogembe also from the state, the governor said; on that day Senator Ogembe was attacked, I was in Kano. I had just received a message of a senator coming home to do empowerment; the next thing was the crisis that ensued.” Senator Melaye and the governor have been embroiled in a bitter power tussle, with the latest being the revelation by Dino that the governor illegally imported military wares into the country without proper clearance. The senate has already mandated an ad-hoc committee to investigate the claims.  Do you have something awesome to share with the world?
