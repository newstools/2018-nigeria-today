 The Social Democratic Party (SDP) has concluded plans to inaugurate two special bodies in its hierarchy to accommodate women and the youths in parliament.This, it said, was part of its efforts to ensure that women and youths were actively mainstreamed into the politics and governance of the country.
 
A statement by the National Secretary, Shehu Musa Gabam in Abuja yesterday said the party strongly believes that the Nigerian women and youths were critical in nation building.It, however, but lamented that they were among the most vulnerable and untapped resources in the country’s governance mix. SDP argued that to effectively tap into this great resource base, the party has initiated the two platforms to facilitate wider and deeper inclusiveness, engagement and participation of women and youth.
 
“Membership process for both parliaments commences from the polling unit to the ward, local councils, state, zonal, and national levels. “The women and youth leaders of the party will serve as leaders of the parliaments, as they sit at the various levels where they are expected to discuss, debate and advise the leadership of the party on creative and innovative solutions for reinventing our nation. “The SDP, as the main force in opposition politics in Nigeria today, remains committed to being a genuine grassroots party, with enough room for women, youths and civil society organisations at all levels,” the statement reads.
