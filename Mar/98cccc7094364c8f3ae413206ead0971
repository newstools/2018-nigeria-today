Agent Ze Maria Neis has said that no discussions have been held with Liverpool regarding the possible transfer of Roma goalkeeper Alisson. Alisson is reportedly attracting interest from both the Premier League and La Liga, with Liverpool and Real Madrid both said to be keen on the 25-year-old. However, Neis has suggested that no consideration is being given to any offers as Roma continue to compete for a top-three place in Serie A and look to progress past Barcelona in the Champions League quarter-finals. Neis told The Sun: “Alisson is certainly one of the best goalkeepers in the world. He loves Roma, 100%. Will he sign a new contract? Now he is focused only in Serie A and on the Champions League. “We have a great relationship with Roma. We never spoke with Liverpool about him. Now Alisson only thinks in present time. I don’t know how much he will cost. It depends about Roma and the transfer market.” The post No Talks Ongoing With Liverpool For Roma Goalkeeper Alisson- Agent appeared first on 360Nobs.com.
