By Ndiana-Abasi Nana Udom Time flies, and we fly with it.
Sometimes we muster the courage to stand up for what we want, sometimes, we don’t.
but, Life has dealt with us in more ways than one.
Amazingly, in our despair, there is what we call hope. When asked about life and hope, Christopher Reeve who played the Super hero – Superman
said “Once you choose hope anything is possible” although he required a wheelchair and
a breathing apparatus for the rest of his life, Mr Reeve lobbied and advocated on behalf of so many people. Before his death in 2004, Reeve created the Christopher
and Dana Reeve foundation to speed up research on spinal cord injuries through funding and grants to improve the quality of lives of people with disabilities. The foundation to date has given more than $65 Million for research and more than $8.5 million in quality of life grants. While we are faced with many challenges, it is very important that we look ahead and behold the many possibilities
lurking around for us.
It is important that we constantly remind ourselves that we are stronger than our challenges.
It is important that we embrace the pains of today in order to avoid the regrets of tomorrow.
