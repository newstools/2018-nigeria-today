Arewa Consultation Forum (ACF) says the interest of the North must be protected at all cost because Nigeria cannot survive without the North. This was made known by the chairman of the forum, Ibrahim Coomassie, on Tuesday when he received the Jammiyar Matan Arewa (JMA), a northern women group, at the secretariat of the forum in Kaduna. “We all know that without the north, Nigeria can never survive, We still stand by it. But now is the time to walk the talk in the interest of our people.” he said Coomassie lamented about the agony faced by northern people due to terrorism. He said Boko Haram has spread from the North-East to the North-Central and even to the southern part of the country. According to him, northern people must not continue to be regarded in the negative side. “See what Boko Haram did to the north-east. They have spread to the north-central and even to the southern part of the country. Should we continue to be regarded in the negative side? No. We are leaders in our own right and we must exercise this responsibility for our people. “Chibok girls are still missing. Now it has gone to Dapchi in Yobe state, what happened? Are we always going to be the victims? “Enough is enough; enough of killings of our women and children; enough of the kidnapping of our daughters and enough of the destruction of our property. We are proud that you have come forward to meet us to discuss this issue.” Do you have something awesome to share with the world?
