By Adeyinka Ademola When things start to fall apart,
we are always thinking they won’t fall back again
Sometimes, we give up on ourselves,
we gave up on hope
And forget who we really are, But if things are falling apart,
just let it fall completely,
that’s what strong people do,
There is a popular saying which goes thus
“often Time we looked so long at the door
that has been closed that we never realize another one has been open. But if everything has fallen apart,
stand up, start all over again, make a plan, draw a table,
rearrange your agenda and make room for consistency. Remember this, never relent, have faith, be prayerful,
stand firm and face your challenges squarely.
If plan A is not working for, look at plan B,
If none of is working, take a deep breath and look deep into yourself. What your talent? Sure,
we all have talent,
God gives them to us to make something out of it,
he gave us because he knows we are going to need it. Discover yours, make it work, never relent, keep striving,
keep going, It’s going to work out one day.
If your dreams are not coming true,
my dear makes use of your talent, use your talent to make it work. If things are not working out fine,
It’s okay, cry if you can, but never relent, don’t be weak,
don’t be a coward You are intelligent,
