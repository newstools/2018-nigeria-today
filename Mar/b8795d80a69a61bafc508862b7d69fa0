Honorable Abdulmumini Jubrin, from Kano state has revealed that his two years suspension has further prepared him for better and more efficient legislative service to his constituents and the nation at large. The former House of Representatives Chairman on Appropriation it would be recalled was suspended on September 16, 2016 for 180 legislative days,over allegations of budget padding as it concerns the 2016 budget. The lawmaker was however recalled on Tuesday, following an apology letter Speaker Yakubu Dogara claimed he tendered to the green chambers. “Today (yesterday), I resumed representation of my constituency and legislative duties at the House of Reps. “The experience of the last 2 years has prepared me even better to rededicate myself towards service of our country. I thank you for your support. I remain eternally grateful. A Jibrin,” he tweeted last night. Do you have something awesome to share with the world?
