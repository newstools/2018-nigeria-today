Furthermore, Ver’s colleague and Bitcoin.com COO Mate Tokay has been welcomed to advisory team of XinFin as well. Ver and Tokay are distinguished names and are considered to be leading influencers within the crypto world and will bring big-time insights and experience to XinFin.io XinFin’s vision aligns with Roger’s philosophy and ideology. Due to the fact that XinFin’s ecosystem will open up to the Global Trade and Finance for USD 27 Trillion market, it will offer everyone the potential for a swift and wealthier individual lifestyle, which supports the idea of libertarianism that is embraced by Roger. Since Roger supports Bitcoin Cash and Mate supports Bitcoin, XinFin decided to add BCH and BTC to their list of accepted currencies for their ongoing Token Sale to trim the impediments for their potential traders and future investors to become a part of XinFin ecosystem. Ecosystem Development Head and Director of XinFin Fintech, Atul Khekade and Peter Yeo seemed quite elated with the latest development and stated: “We are very excited about Roger and Mate joining our Token sale. Roger and Mate enjoy an influential track record in the cryptocurrency industry and have already left their significant footprints in the community. Their powerful engagement coincides with our earnest objection to build and deploy blockchain solutions across global trade and finance and reduce inefficiencies in global commerce with our XDCE Token. Having top-notch personalities from the crypto world, combined with our rapidly growing business powered by our exchange-listed company, makes us all the more confident to set the right path for an integral token growth.” Roger Ver Take a look at any Who’s Who in Bitcoin list and you’ll find Roger Ver near the top of that list. Dubbed ‘Bitcoin Jesus’, Ver is a pioneer for Bitcoin adoption around the world. In 2011, Ver’s company, MemoryDealers.com, became the first mainstream company to accept Bitcoin as a payment option. He is considered to be the first Bitcoin angel investor, having funded the seed rounds for most of the entire first generation of Bitcoin-related organisations and businesses, including: Ver is a proponent of libertarianism and voluntaryism, believing in an individual’s right to freedom of choice, voluntary association, and self-governance. These beliefs are in harmony with XinFin’s mission, which is to deploy blockchain solutions across global trade and finance and reduce inefficiencies in global commerce. XinFin’s hybrid blockchain platform called TradeFinex will offer both tokenized and non-tokenized solutions to promote business process efficiency improvement, thereby helping people undertake projects without burdening govt. treasury and organizations secure and cost-effective business solutions that boost their profitability. Speaking about XinFin, Ver stated: “I am thrilled to be joining a team who, like me, is also focused on everyone’s right to freedom of choice in global trade and finance, enhancing participant and user outcomes through cryptographic money.” Mate Tokay ‘Bitcoin Disciple’ to Ver’s ‘Bitcoin Jesus’, Mate Tokay is without question one of Bitcoin’s most active and vocal proponents. A professional athlete and former wakeboard world champion, Tokay made his first foray into the crypto space when he began mining Bitcoin in 2013 using custom-built ASIC miners. Since then he has gone on to spread the word about Bitcoin and cryptocurrency at conferences and speaking engagements around the world. In keeping with his desire to educate people about Bitcoin, Tokay founded the crypto media news website Bitcoinist in 2013. Since then, he has continued to keep his finger on the pulse of the cryptocurrency industry and has been involved in several successful blockchain-related projects. Tokay’s role within the Bitcoin community has been described as “[focusing] on a larger vision and communicating that vision to others while staying on top of trends in the industry. His goal and passion is to make cryptocurrencies as popular as possible.” Mate Tokay claimed: “I am excited to join the XinFin team in my advisory role strategically as well as operationally. My goal will be to provide complete transparency, fungibility and ease of use and through XinFin and its ecosystem of services; it is on the right path.” XDCE Token Sale In the wake of Roger Ver’s and Mate Tokay’s appointment to XinFin’s Advisory Board, XinFin.io has decided to add Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Bitcoin (BTC) to the list of accepted currencies for its ongoing token sale. XinFin-Ecosystem Development Head Atul Khekade explained: “While Bitcoin is world’s biggest cryptocurrency, BCH also puts on as the future of crypto world—all thanks to its small transactional costs and other prominent benefits. Hence, we trust that these additions will help trim the impediments for our potential traders and future investors to become a part of XinFin ecosystem.” XinFin launched its utility token XDCE on Feb 5, 2018. XDCE is an ERC20 token which will have multifold benefits for traders, private investors and institutional level partners. The exchange rate for XDCE is 1 XDCE= $0.006. Investors can buy tokens using ETH, BCH, BTC, XRP. Long term investors and institutions who wish to use FIAT currency, can also participate through bank transfers. “The XDCE token will predominantly help traders who compete against other ERC20 tokens across various exchanges. XDCE token is swappable which means it can be swapped 1:1 with the standard XDC token without any transaction fee. While our reach becomes more versatile in the open crypto market with this launch, traders will also leverage from XDCE’s compatibility and tradability on most exchanges. Traders can perform quick, high volume trades using XDCE token, allowing institutional level partners to primarily use the XDC01(XDC) token. This will enable XDC01 to grow strictly from use cases whereas traders using XDCE can connect and benefit from growth of standard XDC token.” –XinFin Fintech XinFin launched the TradeFinex platform at the Digital Asset summit organized by Asia’s largest trade and commerce bodies—Assocham (www.assocham.org) and extended the platform to over 450,000 participating enterprise members.
