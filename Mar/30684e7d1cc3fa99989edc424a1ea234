Since 2011, Georgia, an Eastern Europe country that is 60% mountainous, has been trying its damnedest to increase its image as a very attractive winter sports destination. However, now it has been forced to try even harder to restore that effort after 10 people, including nine tourists, were injured last Friday when a ski lift malfunctioned, reports Al Jazeera. The incident happened at the Gudauri ski resort in the Caucasus mountains, near Georgia’s border with Russia: You see, the real potential damage to the country’s image stemmed from a range of video footage that quickly went viral because what it features is crazy as hell. And it’s all encompassed in the video below:  I told you it was intense! Of course, one ski lift malfunction isn’t going to ruin Georgia’s reputation as a safe place to visit: Now that’s something you don’t see every day.
