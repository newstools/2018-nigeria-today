 We all know that water is important to general health and well-being. But are you actually drinking the right amount of water? Perhaps you suspect that some of your health issues are related to dehydration or over-hydration? Getting the right amount of daily water is important because your body needs this to function properly. For a long time, conventional wisdom suggested that we drink 8 glasses of water a day. However, this figure does not have any basis in scientific evidence.[1] Experts instead advise that each person should drink the right amount of water for their body weight, level of physical activity and the climate. So if not 8 glasses, how much? The scientific answer that most healthcare professionals and experts agree on comes from the IoM (Institute of Medicine). The IoM is an independent, non-profit scientific organization and they recommend 2.7 liters of water a day for adult women and the figure of 3.7 liters for adult men. This is generally applicable to adults who have reasonably good health and live a sedentary lifestyle in a temperate climate.  However, there are instances where you may need to drink more water. For example, if you are in a hot climate or take part in demanding physical activity. According to the American College of Sports Medicine, you should aim to add 12 ounces of water to your daily intake for every 30 minutes of demanding physical activity.[2] To put it simply, your body cannot function well without the right amount of hydration. This makes sense when you consider that water makes up around 60% of our body weight. The human body has many important functions to perform and needs water to do most of them. For example, your blood needs to carry oxygen to all the cells in your body but it can only do this with water.[3] If you are not drinking the right amount of water, then you are either dehydrated or over-hydrated. Here are some simple things to look out for if you are dehydrated:  On the other hand, over-hydration or hyponatremia is usually caused by the over consumption of water in a short amount of time.

In fact, some estimate that as many as 75% of Americans are dehydrated.[4] If you are not drinking enough water then you can remedy this by knowing what your correct daily water intake is and drinking up to that amount. Here are some quick ideas to get more water into your diet: Now that you have an idea of how much water you should drink in a day according to scientists, it’s time to adjust your water intake accordingly.

Getting the right amount of daily hydration into your diet will not just benefit your health but also your well-being.
