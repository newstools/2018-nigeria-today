Benue State Government has accused president Muhammadu Buhari of failing to address their major concern when he grudgingly visits the state due to pressure. Speaking on Sunrise daily, a programme on Channels Television, the Special Adviser, Media and ICT to the Governor, Tahav Agerzua, said President Buhari was in Benue but failed to address the situation on the ground. He said some set of people issued a threat six months back to kill Benue people.  According to Agerzua, the people did not just execute their threat by killing hundreds of people, they also destroyed property worth billions of Naira and displaced over 170,000 people. He said Benue people were expecting the president to tell them why these people who issued these threats have not been arrested but the president failed in that regards. He said Benue people are not concerned about the president giving the IG a query, but they are concerned that Buhari is yet to do anything concerning the over 170,000 displaced people in their internally displaced persons’ camps “The Governor asked the President to come to the aid of the IDPs because the state resources have been overstressed. We are still waiting to hear from the president.” He said. Do you have something awesome to share with the world?
