Leader of the All Progressives Congress APC Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu has called on Nigerians not to accept the apology tendered by the opposition People’s Democratic Party PDP for its misconduct while in power. Asiwaju Tinubu made the remarks today in Lagos while speaking at the 10th Bola Tinubu Colloquium in celebration of his 66th birthday anniversary. According to the elder statesman, the APC is redirecting the affairs of the country and would need the cooperation of Nigerians as it wasn’t going to be an easy task. “Do not take their apology, they lie, falsify, changed figures for 16 years . “They made false promises and they say don’t talk about it. It’s like when you catch a thief and they tell you to ignore him and take your own. “We are not doing that, we have hope, we have a good leader to emulate, and we have people to invest,” he said. He said the current APC government was doing all it could to stimulate growth for the economy and called for support for the President Muhammadu Buhari led administration.
