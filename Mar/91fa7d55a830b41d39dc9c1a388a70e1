It was a big day for Liam Payne. Ex-One Direction member and father of Bear, the singer performed in front of senior royals and officials at the Commonwealth Day celebrations at Westminster Abbey in London, reports Independent. Yes, yes, the same day that Meghan Markle and Kate Middleton dressed on point. Also in attendance was the Queen, Prince Charles, his wife Camilla, Prince William, Prince Harry and Theresa May. Although Liam’s rendition of John Mayer’s “Waiting On the World to Change” was acceptable, something about it had Harry acting up. Seated next to his fiancée, Harry was caught apparently rolling his eyes just after the performance ended – and Meghan promptly burst into giggles. You can either watch Liam’s whole performance below, or skip to the three-minute mark to see the moment. That’s Harry top right:  Did you notice it? Personally, I think it had to do with Liam fist-pumping in church. Let’s see it again:  Oh, Harry. I feel like this cheeky behaviour is being egged on by his beloved. What will he be caught doing next!? [source:independent] Do you have something awesome to share with the world?
