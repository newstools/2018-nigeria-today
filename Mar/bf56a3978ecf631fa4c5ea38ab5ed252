England head coach Gareth Southgate has heaped praise on his players following their 1-0 victory over the Netherlands. Jesse Lingard scored the only goal of the night as England emerged victorious at the Amsterdam ArenA, and their coach said that he was pleased with the way they controlled the match. “It was a good test for us, we came away from home and controlled the game. We used the ball really well for 60-65 minutes, maybe more quality in final third was required but we were very solid. We had some good play up to that final ball,” he told ITV. “The back three were excellent and the goalkeeper too, the way they were able to play from the back, they played with real composure, and played with intelligence too. “Playing three at the back is partly system and partly personal, the defenders and goalkeeper are all capable of using the ball really well and we worked out the game tactically to keep the ball higher up. But there are more things we went to see in the Italy game and work on.” The post England Controlled The Game Vs Netherlands- Gareth Southgate appeared first on 360Nobs.com.
