The lawmaker representing Kaduna Central senatorial district in the national assembly, Senator Shehu Sani, says it was wrong for president Muhammadu Buhari to treat the national leader of APC, Bola Tinubu, with so much disdain and contempt after helping him win the 2019 general election. “I must be frank with you, Tinubu has endured a lot of humiliation under the present administration. He was never much consulted, never much recognised as somebody who sacrificed his energy, time and resources to bring the party to where it is.”Sani noted while speaking with Saturday Sun. “It is rather unfortunate that after the party won and the government established, some people started calling some people criminals, thieves and people of questionable character. “The South-West political leaders who contributed to the victory of the party have been treated with disdain and contempt. That is in inimical to the interest of the South-West.” Do you have something awesome to share with the world?
