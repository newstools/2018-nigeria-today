Hi there. It’s Thursday, which happens to be the day of the week when we do Throwbacks. Last week was the Cucumber Rap, and the week before that was the Halls UFO commercial. This time around we’re going to introduce you to another commercial, one that happens to be the most viral commercial in the history of Alabama. Seriously, this one went so viral that TIME even did a piece on it: Having first aired on local TV back in 2006, and with close to 11 million views, it’s time you met Sammy:  Sadly, Flea Market Montgomery permanently closed its doors back in 2009, but that didn’t spell the end of Sammy. He made a pro-Bernie Sanders rap back in 2016, and apparently runs a fan Facebook page here. [source:time] Do you have something awesome to share with the world?
