President Muhammadu Buhari has finally arrived Makurdi, the Benue State capital, for his official visit to the State to commiserate with the people over the New Year killings by herdsmen that claimed the lives of 73 innocent citizens. The president, who is visiting the nationâ€™s acclaimed food basket since assuming power in 2015, arrived the airport at Makurdi at exactly 10:43 a.m. on Monday morning. It is also understood that he will meet with the state Governor, Samuel Ortom, leaders and other stakeholders in the state at the Government House over the recent killings in the state. Reports also have it that he will visit Tor-Tiv, Prof. James Ayatse, the Exercise Cat Race Camp and also meet IDPs in Gbajimba, Guma LGA headquarters. The President had last week visited Taraba State, one of the states troubled with the herdsmen-farmers crisis which has left scores dead and displaced hundreds. While he commiserated with the people over the killings, he described the attacks and bloodshed as unfortunate. President Buhari, therefore, assured Nigerians and victims of the attacks that justice will be served.
