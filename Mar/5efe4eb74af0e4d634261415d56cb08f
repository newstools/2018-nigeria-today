Leicester City manager Claude Puel has confirmed that Super Eagles forward Kelechi Iheanacho sustained a broken hand on international duty but could still feature in the club’s away trip to Brighton and Hove Albion in the Premier League tomorrow. “Almost all the players are fit,” Puel  said in his press conference on Thursday. “Just Iheanacho, who has a broken hand, and (Matty) James. We will see if Iheanacho can play with this injury. “We will see tomorrow in the training session. He (Iheanacho) fell but it’s not a bad injury. We will see if this injury will prevent him from playing at Brighton or not. “It’s not an important injury but it might be strange to play with.” Puel hailed Jamie Vardy who scored for England in their 1-1 draw against Italy. “It’s always important for a striker to score a goal. If he can score for the national team, it’s good for our squad also.” The post Iheanacho’s injury not ‘very’ bad – Puel appeared first on Vanguard News.
