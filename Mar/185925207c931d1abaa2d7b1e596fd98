Ripple price is in a major bearish zone against the US Dollar and Bitcoin. XRP/USD may accelerate declines below the $0.5500 level going forward. There was no upside correction above $0.5800 and $0.5900 in Ripple price against the US Dollar. The price is still in a bearish zone well below the $0.5800 level. A low was formed at $0.5570 before the price corrected slightly. However, the $0.5900 level acted as a resistance. Moreover, the 38.2% Fib retracement level of the last downside move from the $0.6500 swing high to $0.5572 low also prevented upsides. The main hurdle on the upside is near a major bearish trend line forming with resistance near the $0.5750 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. A break above trend line resistance is needed for more gains towards $0.5900. Above $0.5900, the 50% Fib retracement level of the last downside move from the $0.6500 swing high to $0.5572 low may act as the next resistance. Only a close above the $0.6000 level could open the doors for more corrections in the near term.  On the downside, the price may soon break the $0.5572 low. The next major support is near the $0.5000 level. There can be a solid buying interest near the $0.5000 level since it is a key handle for XRP. Looking at the technical indicators: Hourly MACD – The MACD for XRP/USD is still placed nicely in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for XRP/USD is moving lower and is currently below the 50 level.
