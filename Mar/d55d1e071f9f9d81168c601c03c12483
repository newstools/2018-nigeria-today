Deputy Senate President, Ike Ekweremadu, has denied calling for the military to take over in view of the prevailing economic realities in Nigeria. In a statement made available to newsmen by his Special Adviser on Media, Uche Anichukwu. Ekweremadu said this in Yenagoa, Bayelsa State, at a dinner hosted by the Bayelsa state governor Seriake Dickson during the 74th Commonwealth Parliamentary Association (Africa Region) Executive Committee. “Of course, some people took it out of context and said I was calling for a military coup. I never called for a military coup. I never said the military was planning any coup. Even the military’s statement admitted that my statement was only cautionary and that we were sincere. But they went as far as saying that the international community should ignore my words of caution.” “I hold the Nigerian Army and the Armed Forces in high regard. They have defended our democracy, our people and have acquitted themselves creditably. If they need anything now, it is encouragement because this is not the best of times for them. But we do hope that when parliamentarians make statements, they (the military) should be able to know exactly what they said before reacting so that we don’t overheat the system.” Do you have something awesome to share with the world?
