Tottenham manager, Mauricio Pochettino has moved to remind critics of how young Dele Alli is. The 21-year-old has struggled with inconsistent form this season, making him a target for critics. Alli could only play 22 minutes for England on international duty, coming off the bench against Netherlands. And after Southgate said his spot in the England squad is not guaranteed, his club manager, Pochettino has backed him. “I have full confidence in him and his talent and because I know him. He is a great kid and a very good person,” he said. “But he is young. He is 21. If you compare [him] with normal people on the street who are 21, they are still living at home with their parents, they are still at university doing stupid things. “Sometimes we expect too much and we put too much pressure on 21-year-old players. Sometimes we forget and treat them like 40-year-old men. “It’s not like this. We need to be focused on him being still a kid. It’s a lot of pressure on his shoulders and not always can he act how the people and the society expect. That is so important to understand. “We are going to help him because he is a talented player and a great kid. And he has done a lot for us and the club.” The post Pochettino: Easy To Forget Alli Is Still A Kid appeared first on 360Nobs.com. Do you have something awesome to share with the world?
