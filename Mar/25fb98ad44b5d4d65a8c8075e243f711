A former governor of Adamawa state, Murtala Nyako says even if a mechanic takes the All Progressive Congress to court, it was very clear that the court will lock the national secretariat of the party over the unconstitutional and undemocratic tenure extension of party officials. Nyako disclosed this in Yola yesterday while addressing hundreds of APC supporters at his residence. According to Nyako “If there was no convention in APC before the general elections, the party may become a spectator instead of a participant. He said the actions of those who feel the party was their private estate will not make APC move forward. “Some of our political leaders seem to take ‘Ogogoro’ before taking action or making public statements on important issues because some of their statements do not reflect or contain any reasonable sense.” Do you have something awesome to share with the world?
