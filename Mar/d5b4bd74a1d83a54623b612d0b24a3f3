Port Louis, Mauritius | AFP | The vice-president of Mauritius assumed temporary power on Friday a week after the resignation of President Ameenah Gurib-Fakim over allegations of a credit card scandal. A statement from the presidency said Paramasivum Pillay Vyapoory had assumed the functions of the president on 23 March. He will hold the position until he is either confirmed by parliament or someone else is appointed. Gurib-Fakim, Africa’s only female head of state, submitted her resignation in the “national interest” following accusations that she used a bank card provided by an NGO to make personal purchases, including jewellery and luxury goods worth at least 25,000 euros. In a statement as she handed over power on Friday, Gurib-Fakim said she had “a heavy heart” but insisted that she would be cleared by any investigation.
