UCLA’s Hammer Museum might be known for exhibiting modern examples of progressive artworks, but Will Ferrell and Joel McHale just don’t quite get it. Featuring in a short film created for the museum’s new “Stories of Almost Everyone” exhibition, the two comics get a VIP tour from Hammer curator Aram Moshayedi. The pair are openly “bewildered, sometimes verging on disparaging, by the everyday objects that make up the show”, reports AdWeek: This one is a good time:  So what is “Stories of Almost Everyone”, which opened January 28, all about? Well, according to the museum, it’s “an exhibition about the willingness to believe the stories that are conveyed by works of contemporary art”: Did you get any of that? I guess now we’re all Ferrell and McHale. [source:adweek] Do you have something awesome to share with the world?
