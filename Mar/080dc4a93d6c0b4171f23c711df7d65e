Eusebio Di Francesco says  he and Vincenzo Montella are hoping to meet in the final of the UCL, and hope to avoid each other in the quarterfinals. Roma went through to the last-8 after a 1-0 win over Shakhtar Donetsk at home, saw them progress on away goal. Sevilla on the other hand, stunned Manchester United at Old Trafford, to win 2-1, with Ben Yedder coming off the bench to score a quick brace. Di Francesco and Montella were teammates at Roma, and the Roma coach has joked he would like to meet his friend in the final. “I spoke to Vincenzo Montella a few days ago and we aim to meet in the final, this is why as friends we do not want to face each other at this stage of the competition,” he said. “Joking aside, we have to dream and be ambitious. I am not interested about the team we will face. Now we have to think of taking in what we have done.” The post Di Francesco: Montella And I Hoping To Meet In Final appeared first on 360Nobs.com.
