Las Palmas manager Paco Jemez has picked Oghenekaro Etebo in his match day squad for Saturday’s La Liga Santander clash against fellow relegation battlers, Deportivo La Coruna reports Completesportnigeria.com. Etebo missed his side’s last two training session to see a specialist in Madrid on his quadriceps. But, according to a source very close to the player, the result of the scan revealed no major damage so the 22 year old was included in Jemez’s 25-man squad for the game. Etebo has made one assist in seven starts for the club. Also included in the squad is Imoh Ezekiel who has made two appearances since arriving at the club in January. But Jemez will be without Emmanuel Emenike who is yet to feature for the club since he joined on a loan deal from Olympiakos due to a persistent knee injury. Las Palmas who currently sit 18th in the Spanish La Liga Santander table are without a win in the last six league games drawing three and losing three.
