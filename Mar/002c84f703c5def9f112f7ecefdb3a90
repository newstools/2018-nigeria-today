 A Nigerian man of God based in Zambia is now the butt of attentions after he made his church members lick his shoes for miracles. Prophet Ejimadu who is also known as Seer 1 is about one of the most popular and respected men of God in the eastern African country and many see him as one capable of having direct communication with God.

The 39-year-old Prophet Ejimadu posted photos at a crusade he held where the incident happened on the church's Facebook page with the words: "I have blessed your legs. I have washed your feet. First thing tomorrow morning, if you type Amen and share this post, someone will call you and your feet will carry you there to pick a special gift. Many people will miss this. Try it."
