 “Never give up. Today is hard, tomorrow will be worse, but the day after tomorrow will be sunshine.” – Jack Ma We’ve all been there, life is not fair, mistakes happen, life happen but we are still standing. Sometimes, we feel like just throwing in the towel because we think life is meaningless and our effort are worthless, trust me, I’ve been there. The trials, the mistakes, working in between jobs, the demands of family, the stress of relationship (its happens sometimes), life can be so frustrating, but amidst the frustration and trials, amid all the setbacks and heartbreaks, life is beautiful. Take time and reflect on these quotes: Take this moment as yours and define a new path for yourself, you may stumble, you may fail, but as long as you keep pushing you will succeed. You are good at something, that thing is called “talent” make it your passion, love it, develop it, work on it and you will earn from it. Apply the smart work strategy not hard work. have a time schedule for all your activities including having fun and make every minutes counts. So focus on doing what you love, even if you make mistakes don’t give, try and try again. Instead of crying about yesterday or what you have lost, set a target and plan on changing tomorrow, yesterday is gone and you can’t do anything about it. 10.To live a fulfilled life, we need to keep creating the “what is next”, of our lives. Without dreams and goals there is no living, only merely existing, and that is not why we are here. – Mark Twain Always keep a detailed plan “What next is a good way to start” When you finish with a task continue with “what next” until you reach your goal.
