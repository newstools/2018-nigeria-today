The organization’s National Caretaker Secretary Alhaji Aliyu Abubakar in a statement said the Federal Government’s intervention was needed for peace to reign in the areas, one of such interventions according to the group was a total cancellation of the Benue and Taraba anti-grazing laws. “Federal government should for the interest of peace and harmony, force the cancellation of the notorious anti-grazing laws being enacted by both Benue and Taraba states aimed at only persecuting the Fulani herders and all Fulani people nationwide,” the statement read in part. He urged the fulanis to continue to live in peace in whatever community they find themselves. It went further to warn against any plan to auction cattles and other livestocks belonging to Fulanis by the Benue and Taraba states governments.
