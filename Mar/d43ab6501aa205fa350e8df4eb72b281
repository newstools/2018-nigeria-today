Oguma Foundation in honour of the former governor, National Chairman of the PDP Uche Secondus described Ibori as someone who believes in the welfare of the people. “Ibori is a factor in Nigeria who has great following in Delta and across the country. Ibori believes in the welfare of the people and believes that the young shall grow and that the women must take their rightful place. “APC has plunged Nigeria into insecurity, hunger and crisis. In PDP controlled states, all our governors have fulfilled their promises to the people,” he said.  Do you have something awesome to share with the world?
