Austin would have been on a high after yet another successful SXSW conference, but a series of bombings this month have dampened the mood considerably. The latest incident happened last night, just hours after police made an appeal to the individual – or individuals – behind the three previous incidents to contact them This time, two people were seriously injured after reportedly tripping a wire of a package left next to the side of the road, reports New York Times: The three previous attacks have already taken the lives of two men, and have left a further two women with injuries, reports CNBC: Although authorities have no idea who the culprit is, they believe the explosions are connected and are possibly race-related: all of the victims have been African-American or Hispanic. A picture from last night’s incident:  Chief Manley said in a follow-up press conference on Monday that the possibility that the bomb was triggered by a trip wire, and the fact that the explosive device was left next to the road, “necessitated a new warning to the public,” reports kxan: More than 500 federal agents are now involved in the investigation, and authorities continue to ask the local community for assistance. A reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of whoever’s responsible was raised from $50 000 to $115 000. Could the States have another Unabomber case on their hands? Let’s hope it doesn’t take around two decades to find him / her / them. [source: kxan&cnbc&nytimes] Do you have something awesome to share with the world?
