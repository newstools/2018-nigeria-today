By Abel Udoekene I spent most nights crying my heart out,
When I remember how far your love has taken me,
I have walked on this earth confused and lost,
I have abandoned a beggar on the street who stares at me for help,
yet, I kneel every night looking up to heaven for answers. I am a broken piece that has been fixed by your grace.
I try to be good when I Can,
I smile a lot at strangers,
I allow people to take advantage of my creativity,
Sometimes, I pretend that all is well,
Sometimes, I lie. But the truth is, your love is stronger than my imperfection,
You are the rock I stand upon,
the light that guides my path,
the answers to my every need,
the inspiration, the love, and the success I seek in life. You are my strength when I`m weak,
the force I feel within my bones
my stability in every passing moment,
the hope that inspires my every breath,
Thank you for loving me despite my imperfection. Do you have something awesome to share with the world? Click here to share Do you ever have any question about anything you wish to ask and get answer? Click here to ask Follow us on twitter @NigeriaTodayNG Also, Like us on facebook
