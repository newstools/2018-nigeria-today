Timo Werner, Red Bull Leipzig striker says he will still be with the club next season, despite major interest in his services. The 22-year-old Germany international has attracted interest from major clubs in Europe. Werner scored 21 goals in 31 Bundesliga appearances last season, and already has 10 goals from 24 this season. United, Liverpool, Madrid and Bayern Munich have showed interest in the striker, but he intends to stay till next season. Werner was asked if he’d stay at Leipzig until the end of his contract in 2020 and he replied: “Next year, definitely.” Earlier in the week, Werner indicated he’d like to play in the Premier League at some stage in his career. “Playing in the Premier League is a dream for me,” he told FourFourTwo. “I would like to play for two or three clubs, and Manchester United are one of those clubs. But probably not in the next few years – later, when my English is a little bit better! I’m very comfortable at RB Leipzig, though.” The post Werner: I Will Be At Leipzig Next Season appeared first on 360Nobs.com. Do you have something awesome to share with the world?
