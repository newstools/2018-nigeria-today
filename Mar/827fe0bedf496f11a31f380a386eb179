The All Progressives Congress APC has reacted to yesterday’s revelation by President Muhammadu Buhari that he was not aware the Inspector General of Police Ibrahim Idris flouted presidential order for him to relocate to Benue state, in the face of the recent killings of farmers by suspected Fulani herdsmen. Buhari had yesterday during his interaction with stakeholders in Makurdi revealed that he just got to discover that the police boss did not relocate to Benue as ordered. The revelation had sparked reactions from Nigerians who were miffed that the president’s orders can be flouted without regard for the office. APC spokesman Bolai Abdullahi while reacting to the backlash that followed the president’s revelation also said the president was ready to take measures to deal with the situation. “What the President said with regard to the IG shows the level of sincerity of Mr. President. “It takes a very honest and courageous man to say what the President said and I am sure the President is ready to deal with the situation arising from that. “If the opposition see things differently you can’t blame them. They are looking for anything, just anything to bounce back to relevance but Nigerians are wiser,” he said.  Do you have something awesome to share with the world?
