There are indications that Former Governor of Oyo State, Senator Rashidi Adewolu Ladoja may dumb the People Democratic Party (PDP) soon according to a source who confided in our correspondent. Nigeria Today gathered that the crisis in the Oyo State chapter of the People Democratic party has taken a new turn with both Makinde’s and Ladoja’s faction failing to honour the harmonize list put forward by the national leadership of the party. Recall that due to the two parallel congress held by both factions, the national leadership of the party had to step in and ceded 14 slots to Ladoja’s faction,  while 12 slot went to Makinde’s faction. “Right now, he (Ladoja) is considering so many options, People from SDP and APC are currently in touch with him” The source said. “But I can tell you, his heart is with the PDP, the PDP can win Oyo state easily if they can reconcile all factions. Because, If you look at the records of Ajimobi, you will cry for Nigeria, people like him deserve a good spot in hell. “Nigerians are eagerly waiting for the PDP to sent Buhari and his co-travellers packing in 2019, if the PDP is serious, they should start full and true reconciliation from the South West” Do you have something awesome to share with the world?
