A few months ago,  Segun Awolowo Jnr. was removed from his enviable position as Director General, Nigerian Export Promotion Council, NEPC.  Immediately the news broke, his traducers went to town dancing and proclaiming that they had seen his end.
Even in the face of the trying time,  he was said to have taken everything in good faith. Rather than being crestfallen,  he went down in prayer for God to do His will in his life.
As fate would have it, the grandson of the late political sage, Chief Obafemi Awolowo,  has shamed his critics,  as he has been recalled to his former position.
Though many are reportedly attributing his re-appointment to his being a cousin to the wife of the Vice President, Dolapo Osinbajo, those who know better say it was based on hard work and dedication during the era of former President Goodluck Jonathan.
