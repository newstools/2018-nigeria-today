Over in the Land of the Free, Donald Trump is doing his utmost to keep up the ridiculousness that has been his presidency. When Gary Cohn announced his resignation as chief economics advisor, Trump quickly pinned CNBC commentator and radio host Lawrence – or Larry – Kudlow as his replacement. He then confirmed the appointment on Twitter earlier today. It was a surprising choice, and not only because Kudlow is a “free-trade advocate who opposes Trump’s decision to apply tariffs on imported aluminium and steel,” reports Inquisitr. You see, Kudlow is a reformed alcoholic who once had a $100 000 (R1,1 million) per month cocaine habit. I’m surprised his nose still works. In 1994, as a result of his cocaine and alcohol problems, “Kudlow was forced to resign from the investment bank Bear Stearns”. Admitting his problems, he went to rehab for five months: Awks, but understandable – we all have our demons. Kudlow attracted Trump’s attention when he endorsed him during the 2016 presidential election campaign (or maybe he has high TV ratings), and has “informally advised Trump on taxes and other financial issues” in the past. But while Trump has confirmed Kudlow as Cohn’s replacement, Trump is a little worried that Kudlow may not support his position on tariffs. Because, you know, if things don’t go down well between the two then Kudlow might not last that long. No doubt he will be sacked via Twitter, just like Rex Tillerson, before Trump’s reign ends.
