The suggestions for who plays the next James Bond has gone from a black man to a woman and now a black woman, as suggested by actor Idris Elba. The famed black British actor became a popular name across the Twitterverse as the potential man to replace Daniel Craig as the secret agent who prefers his martinis shaken, not stirred. Though Elba never snagged the role, he now suggests that even casting him would not be woke enough. Speaking with Variety at the Sundance Film Festival, Elba reflected on the future identity of James Bond. “Are we interested in having a Bond character other than being a male?” Elba asked. “It could be a woman, could be a black woman, could be a white woman, but I think, that character, everybody would like to see it have — do something different with it, why not?” Yes, why not?! As Esquire observes, “Ian Fleming wrote James Bond as a white man, but that was more than half a century ago. Certainly after 65 years it’s time to freshen up the franchise to be a little more…modern. Plus, there have already been books in the Bond canon about female spies. In the early 2000s, a series of books called The Moneypenny Diaries were published chronicling the missions of the popular Fleming character. If there’s any time for that, it’s certainly now.”   __________ Follow us on Twitter at @thesignalng Copyright 2018 SIGNAL.
