 Kampala, Uganda | THE INDEPENDENT | Up to 50 universities in the UK are to be part of a pilot scheme to rank their teaching quality and value of degrees they award. In other words, which degrees make a student rich and the ones that don’t. Universities Minister Sam Gyimah said: “Prospective students deserve to know which courses deliver great teaching and great outcomes – and which ones are lagging behind. “In the age of the student, universities will no longer be able to hide if their teaching quality is not up to the world-class standard that we expect.” The new system to rate teaching is part of the government’s attempt to get tough on universities, which charge students nearly £30,000 for a three-year degree.
