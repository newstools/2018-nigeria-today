US President Donald Trump has suggested that Oprah Winfrey might want to think twice about running against him in 2020, predicting that the campaign “would be a painful experience for her.” Trump brought up the potential 2020 rival at a rally on Saturday night in western Pennsylvania to help GOP congressional candidate Rick Saccone in a special election, where he couldn’t help but run through one of the more tantalizing match-ups for his own reelection. Election Day for the Pennsylvania seat is on Tuesday. Winfrey became the source of speculation about run after a powerful speech at the Golden Globes, though she then tamped down the idea. In an interview with People, she kept alive the possibility of getting a signal from God. As The Hill noted, Trump also went after Winfrey after she interviewed voters on CBS ’60 Minutes.’ Watch video below:  The post Trump Wants Oprah To Run For President – “It Would Be A Painful Experience For Her” appeared first on 360Nobs.com.
