 Imo plans LG election for June The Rivers State Independent Electoral Commission (RSIEC) has fixed June 16, 2018 for local council elections amid threats by the APC to sue the commission.RSIEC chairman, Justice Chukwuneye Uriri, had cautioned political parties in the state to abide by the rules governing the conduct of election and avoid any acts of violence. Uriri stated this while addressing representatives of no fewer than 67 political parties during a stakeholders meeting held at the commission’s secretariat in Port Harcourt.“By the powers conferred on me, as enshrined in the Rivers State Independent Electoral Law No 2 of 2018, I therefore declare Saturday, June 16 for council election in Rivers State. It is accordingly so fixed,” he said. But APC chairman, Davis Ikanya, described the date as illegal, saying several cases were pending in the Supreme Court and the State High Court over council election in the state.He pointed out that there has been a protracted legal battle at the Supreme Court over the sacking of 22 local government council chairmen elected a few days before the expiration of immediate past administration of Governor Chibuike Amaechi by a Port Harcourt Federal High Court in 2015. Also, the Imo State Governor, Rochas Okorocha has said council election would hold in June. He disclosed this yesterday while responding to questions on his return from the Sam Mbakwe International Cargo Airport, Owerri, insisting that the polls would hold in the 27 local councils of the state.
