Nobel Laureate Profesor Wole Soyinka says victims of violent clashes in Benue, Plateau, Taraba and Nasarawa states don’t deserve sympathy but justice. Soyinka who spoke today in Lagos said it was appalling when people demand that President Muhammadu Buhari should visit and sympathize with victims of the various clashes instead of demanding for justice. “I get impatient when I hear things like Buhari has failed to go and sympathise with the people of Benue, with the people of Nassarawa, with the people of Dapchi or wherever. “Who needs sympathy? Is it sympathy that will reorder their broken lives? Is sympathy the issue? We are speaking here of one commodity that is fundamentally human deserving, justice. “There should an internal measure to avoid repeat. We are speaking here of a president that will respond with massive action and not showing up at the arena of human desecration to shed any unjust tears, but give orders that the bloodthirsty terrorists are brought to book,” he said.
