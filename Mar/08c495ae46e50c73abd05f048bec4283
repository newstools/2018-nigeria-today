Antonio Conte has backed Chelsea striker Alvaro Morata to play an important role in the final games of the Premier League season and boost his chances of making Spain’s squad for the World Cup this year. Alvaro Morata made a brisk start after signing from Real Madrid in the close season but has gone off the boil in recent weeks. He scored the last of his 10 league goals in this campaign in December as Chelsea beat Brighton 2-0. The 25-year-old was left out of Julen Lopetegui’s Spain squad for last week’s international friendlies against Germany and Argentina but Conte said Morata had used the time during his enforced break to raise the level of his game. “He has been working very well, and he needed to work hard. Now he is really fit and is ready to have an important end to the season for Chelsea,” Conte told reporters on Thursday.
