President Muhammadu Buhari says he is glad Nigerian youths have realized the enormous potentials embedded in the agricultural sector, instead of waiting for white collar jobs. The president made this disclosure yesterday when he played host to the Tunisian Foreign Minister Boukekri Rmilli yesterday at the presidential villa in Abuja. According to a statement credited to presidential media aide Malam Garba Shehu, Buhari also said his administration was trying very hard to provide jobs for teeming Nigerian youths. “We are trying very hard to provide jobs, for our youths. We are investing heavily in agriculture. “Following the uncertainty in the oil market and the huge unemployment situation in the country, we chose to put our fate in agriculture. I am glad that our young people are accepting agriculture instead of waiting for white-collar jobs. “They are out there sweating it out in the sun, making a living. Agriculture is the way to go, even when we are realizing this almost belatedly,” the statement read in part. He commended Tunisia for the progress it was making in agriculture and expressed happiness with the resuscitation of the Nigeria – Tunisia Binational Commission.
