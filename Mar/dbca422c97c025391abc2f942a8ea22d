Contrary to reports of a jail break by two alleged suspects in the case of Senator Dino Melaye, the Kogi State Command of the Nigeria Prisons Service has denied any of such saying all its facilities in the state were intact. Martyns Apebende, Controller of Prisons in the state while speaking to journalists on Thursday said the duo of Kabiru Seidu, aka Osama and Nuhu Salisu, aka Small escaped from police cells and not from facilities of the prison service. In his clarification of the matter, Apebende said other security formations in the state equally had detention facilities where suspects were kept before being arraigned in court. He urged members of the public to “avoid spreading misleading information that could create unnecessary anxiety in otherwise peaceful quarters”.
