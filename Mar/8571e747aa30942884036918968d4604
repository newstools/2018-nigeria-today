The main opposition party, the Peoples democratic party (PDP) has apologize to Nigerians for mistakes it made while it was in charge of teh county. The PDP who ruled the country for 16 years since the return to democracy in 1999 tendered the apology through its national chairmain, Uche Secondus. “We made mistakes. On behalf of my colleagues and members of this party, I apologise to Nigerians,” Secondus said. “We have learnt from our mistakes. It was all part of our evolution process. Without it, there can be no maturity. I believe that PDP is more matured, to provide the best for this country.” Secondus also attacked APC for running a government of propaganda and the government for failing to stop Boko Haram menace. “We believe that everybody is aware now that APC government is using propaganda, intimidation, blackmail and running down the opposition,” he said. “The fight against corruption can not and must not be selective. All anti-corruption agencies were established during PDP 16 years in government. Credit should be given to us. “Boko Haram has not only remained alive, but spreading under a new name, despite several political claims of dismantling it”.
