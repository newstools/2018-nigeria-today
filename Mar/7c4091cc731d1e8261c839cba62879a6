I have followed many games on the television and I think the first game I attended live was last season against West Brom. “I was so impressed by the pace, the exchange of positions [while] keeping the balance of the team. The team has the right mix of pace, aggressiveness, positional game. “I remember that week, they [also] played a midweek [EFL Cup] game against Spurs. Liverpool tinkered the line-up but, despite 10 or 11 changes, the team played mostly at the same level and it was great to see. To be honest, I really like [Klopp]; I followed him before when he worked in Dortmund and I think he is doing great.” The post Former Liverpool Cosch Pako Ayestaran Impressed By Jurgen Klopp’s Work At The Club appeared first on 360Nobs.com.
