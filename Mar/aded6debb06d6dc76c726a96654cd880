A former president,  Olusegun Obasanjo says the failure of president Muhammadu Buhari and other African union leaders to sign the African Union Continental Free Trade Area (AUCFTA), was criminal. In statement curled from  a video posted by NBS Rwanda at African trade agreement, Obasanjo said he was surprised that some African leaders at a time like now will fail to understand continental free trade area. “I’m surprised that any African leader at this point in time will be talking about either not understanding the Continental free trade area or not to support what we’re going to sign. I see that as criminal.” He said “The signing and implementation of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) will enable a shift from dependence on assistance to increased trade. “The establishment of the Free Trade Area will result in the establishment of a market of over one billion two hundred million people, with a combined gross product of over three trillion dollars.” “That is where our salvation lies, trading amongst ourselves and consequently developing our economies. The agreement will inspire a change a perception of the continent by the rest of the world,”  he added    Do you have something awesome to share with the world?
