Benue state governor Samuel Ortom has subtly begged President Muhammadu Buhari for a ‘soft loan’ to enable him pay salaries of civil servants in the state. Ortom made the appeal yesterday while playing to the president who was in the state to commiserate with victims of the January 1st killings by suspected Fulani herdsmen. According to the governor, his administration inherited about N7.8billion from the past administration and was finding it impossible to pay workers wages as at when due. “The issue of backlog of salaries remains intractable. Part of the problem of salaries was inherited from the past government. “In spite of your efforts with Bailout Funds and Paris Club Refunds which we appreciate, the challenge still remains due to the high wage bill in the average of N7.8billion which we inherited. “We request for a grant or soft loan to be able to pay the arrears even as we have taken steps to stabilize regular salary payment with effect from January this year,” he said.
