Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino has said that striker Harry Kane remains doubtful for the club’s Premier League clash with Chelsea. Last month, Harry Kane sustained ankle ligament damage against Bournemouth and it was initially feared that the 24-year-old would be absent until the end of April. However, a report claimed that the striker was nearing a return to action, and Pochettino has acknowledged that the team’s top goalscorer was closing in on an appearance in his first-team squad. At a press conference, the 46-year-old told reporters: “We need to assess him. He’s very positive and he is doing very well. Every day, he is improving. “We need to assess him over the next few days. I think it is difficult now to say yes or no to be involved.” The post Harry Kane Likely To Miss Premier League Match Vs Chelsea- Mauricio Pochettino appeared first on 360Nobs.com.
