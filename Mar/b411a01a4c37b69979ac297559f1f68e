Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission EFCC Ibrahim Magu says he does not believe Nigeria’s rating by Transparency International T.I as regards corruption. T.I had rated Nigeria low in its 2017 rating of the global corruption perception index. Magu who spoke in Enugu over the weekend said corruption was fighting back. “We have met almost every demand. So it’s corruption fighting back. You will see them carrying a lot of false information, buying all the media organisations. I don’t believe in that TI rating, I don’t believe it’s real because from what we have done, we have worked very hard and we have recorded a lot of successes that had never been recorded before in this country; it has never been done so well. I’m not giving the credit for myself. “We have never done so well like this before. When you go through this list, you will see how they even arrived at the perception, if you go from these variables, all other variables minus one, the rating of Nigeria compared to 2016 has increased, the only last variable which they gave us low mark is not issue of corruption,” he said.
