That is one of Elon Musk’s many theories, shared with the public via a Rolling Stone interview last year. Now it appears that Musk’s next venture, following “electric vehicles, space exploration, and brain-computer interfaces”, is apparently going to be comedy, reports The Daily Beast: A prime example:  But this nugget of information wasn’t really unearthed until The Onion published a piece early February titled “Elon Musk Offering $1,2 Billion in Grants to Any Project That Promises to Make Him Feel Complete.” While its short paragraph was packed with satire that The Onion readers have come to know and love, there was, in fact, a sliver of truth to it. The Daily Beast is able to confirm that “several former top staffers and writers of The Onion are now working on a secret project financially backed by Musk”. Mind blown: Keeping many of their friends and former colleagues in the dark, many have speculated that it could be another written satirical news website. However, it’s unclear what the exact project is, or whether it’s getting a lovely sliver of the fictitious $1,2 billion, but Bolton and Berkley did say in a joint statement that: Although I am all for a Musk-funded satirical site, I do think competition is healthy and Musk should do better finding his own writers.
