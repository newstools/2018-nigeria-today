Can we take a moment to once again enjoy the fact that Jacob Zuma is no longer our president? Damn, that still brings a smile to my face. Of course the ANC and their upper echelons are still packed with people who represent the worst of his reign (Ace Magashule, here’s looking at you), but perhaps in due course they’ll be shown the door. As for Zuma and his retirement, what does his average day entail? His brother, Khanya Zuma, spoke to IOL about life at Nkandla:   It appears plundering the state coffers and selling your citizens to the highest bidder kept JZ busy, but he’s finally getting to enjoy the fruits of his labour. Maybe Zuma’s waking up early because he’s due back in court rather soon: Yes, the evil apartheid system made him do it. Durban High Court. April 6. Maybe this is finally, actually, the moment he is made to pay for his misdeeds? You can bet he’s going down swinging.
