The Arewa Youth Consultative Forum, AYCF has berated President Muhammadu Buhari for finding time to attend a recent wedding in Kano state. National President of the forum Shettima Yerima while speaking to journalists said though it was not out of place for the president to attend weddings, the timing of his attendance at the Kano wedding was inappropriate considering the mood of the nation. To me, there’s nothing wrong in attending to a wedding, but it was a wrong time for him to go when the country is boiling. An injury to all is an injury to all. Why going for a wedding with 25 governors while there blood all over the country. I think it is uncalled for,” he said. Yerima also spoke on the current situation in the northern part of the country describing it as a really bad situation and likely a script being played out by some selected people to disunite the country. “The situation is really sad and uncalled for. It is a challenging period for the nation, no doubt. Bloodletting everywhere, coupled with poverty and unemployment. If the government was up and doing, the situation would have changed. “From my observations, I think the killings in the nation is a script people are working on to disunite Nigeria and they are trying to align it to a particular ethnic group or religion. Call them Fulani or whatever, a criminal is always a criminal and should be treated as one,” he added. Do you have something awesome to share with the world?
