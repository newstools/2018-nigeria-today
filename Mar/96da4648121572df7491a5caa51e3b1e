Former president, Olusegun Obasanjo says his daughter, Iyabo Obasanjo is ready to deal with anyone who tries to lift a finger at her. Obasanjo disclosed this while speaking at the 14th annual lecture of the Women in Management, Business and Public Service at the Eko Hotel and Suites, Lagos on Thursday. Obasanjo while urging women to play a more active role in politics said Nigeria has many women of virtue, character and integrity who can lead the country to the glory land. “I had two girls before I had a boy. I had thought that I would never have a boy before I had a boy. But it doesn’t matter who you are in our own family “My first child, my daughter (Iyabo) will not take nonsense from you. And you try it; you would be put in your place. It doesn’t matter; you may be 10 times her height, she will bring you down. (It is) because I give them the encouragement and you heard, eight of my children have PhDs. I have slightly more boys than girls but I have more girls with PhD than boys.” Do you have something awesome to share with the world?
