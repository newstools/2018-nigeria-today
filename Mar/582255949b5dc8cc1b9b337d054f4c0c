Lauren Greenfield is back, once again looking at how the American dream has evolved. You might recognise the name – Greenfield is the documentarian and photographer behind 2012’s Queen of Versailles, “a cautionary tale about one family’s efforts to build the largest home in America”. And her latest offering, Generation Wealth, is a natural extension of that theme. It looks at the consumerism culture – and those values – that has taken the U.S. by storm and, as it widens the scope of the Versailles family, looks back on 25 years’ worth of Greenfield’s work, reports The Daily Beast. In short, the documentary is a “deep dive into the lives of her subjects, captured over decades, and a meditation on consumerism, Kardashian culture, and the rise and fall of the American empire”: Years later, Greenfield finds almost all of her grown-up subjects traumatised by their lavish childhoods. But the doccie doesn’t try garner support for them, the children of the rich and famous. Rather, it opens up a larger conversation about “our collective greed, and its price”. Subjects include a “Toddlers & Tiaras cast member, a former porn star who got plastic surgery in an attempt to escape her own fetishised image, and an ex-hedge fund manager who can’t return to the U.S. for fear of prosecution”: Trailer time:  Clearly money can be a complicated drug, and Greenfield treats it like an addiction. The only problem is, she herself wants more. The film is set to be released in the U.S. on July 20. [source:thedailybeast] Do you have something awesome to share with the world?
