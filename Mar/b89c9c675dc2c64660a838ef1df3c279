An app which seeks to give Nigerians an easy means of reporting corruption related cases have been launched by the Federal Government. Senior special assistant to President Muhammadu Buhari on prosecution, Okoi Obono-Obla, who launched the app code named DoroCorruption today in Abuja, said it would be difficult for government to go after and prosecute corrupt individuals if they have little or no information. “My panel will investigate assets of public officers, but have you given us information on public officers who have assets that are beyond their legitimate earnings? “We know them. Most of the buildings in Abuja are owned by directors in public service. How much are they earning? You know these people, they are your neighbours and you don’t give us information. How then do we help government fight corruption?” “We need the support of civil society, the civil society should assist the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) in getting information on those that have properties abroad but don’t pay tax in Nigeria. This would help in taming corruption in the country,” he said. Do you have something awesome to share with the world?
