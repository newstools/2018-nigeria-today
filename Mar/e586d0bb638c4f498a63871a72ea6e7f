Governor of Rivers State, Nyesom Wike, says the proposed  visit of president Muhammadu Buhari to Rivers state will not resurrect the All Progressives Congress (APC) which is dead in the state. According to a statement made available to news men by his media aide, Simeon Nwakaudu, Wike said he has not being fully  briefed on reasons why president Buhari was visiting the state, but was very certain that apart from Jesus Christ who can resurrect the dead, Buhari has no such powers to improve the fortune of APC in the state. “I have not been told the president is coming and why he is coming. He has the right to come to any state” He said Wike hoped Buhari will use his planned visit to Rivers to complete the Port Harcourt International Airport, the neglected east-west road, the neglected seaports and the rejected Port Harcourt-Aba road. “Maybe the president is coming to make sure that he will improve the fortunes of the APC that is dead in Rivers state. “Apart from Jesus Christ, we don’t know of anyone who has risen a dead thing. APC is a dead party in Rivers state. No matter how you fast and pray, it will never wake up. “We have never had herdsmen killings or crisis in the state, except when some criminals tried to disrupt the peace and they were checked. We resolved that challenge. “Since the administration has abandoned Rivers State for three years, this visit may be a blessing in disguise. The president may use the visit to complete the Port Harcourt International Airport, the neglected east-west road, the neglected seaports and the rejected Port Harcourt-Aba road.” Do you have something awesome to share with the world?
