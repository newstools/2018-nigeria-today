Governor of Rivers state, Nyesom Wike says he will fast and pray for God to keep Rtd. General Danjuma alive. Wike said this on Monday during the swearing-in ceremony of judges in Port Harcourt. Commenting on the statement of Danjuma about the alleged non-neutrality of the Nigerian army, Wike said that Nigeria has gotten to a point where Nigerians don’t know the direction the country is heading. “I don’t fast, but I will fast and pray to God to keep General Danjuma. General Theophilus Danjuma has said the truth. It is happening daily in Rivers state.” he said Wike admitted that the statement of Danjuma was true and the non-neutrality of the Nigerian army was happening daily in Rivers state. “We only replicated what is in existence in Lagos state, but nobody queries that of Lagos state. Only recently, Nasarawa state launched her outfit, without being challenged. “The recent deliberate crisis and threat of violence by the APC on the setting up of the neighbourhood safety corps underscores the devilish schemes to promote insecurity in Rivers state.” Do you have something awesome to share with the world?
