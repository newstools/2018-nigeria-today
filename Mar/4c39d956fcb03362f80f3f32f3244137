Jennifer Garner is one of those celebs who flies a little under the radar. I’m sure the Daily Mail still has a paparazzi or two on her tail 24/7, but it’s not like her name is splashed across headlines around the world on the regular. Considering that every Instagram post by the likes of Kim K, Emily Rat and Kendall Jen turns into tabloid fodder, how is it that Garner’s account goes by largely unnoticed? Buzzfeed is on board, and they’re determined to make sure Jen’s work is seen by the world. They’ve announced that “We Need To Talk About Jennifer Garner’s Instagram Videos Immediately”, adding that “Not one more day can go by without a nationwide conversation about these”. One should start from the beginning, which was her first ever Instagram video:  Way to make an entrance, girl. Her latest video is also worthy of a chit-chat: Bit harsh on Kenny G (who has a super saxy Instagram himself), but she does bust this one out with aplomb:  There are a number of videos of Jennifer reading to her dog, and who amongst us hasn’t, but how about chatting with Regina George, her chicken?  Just like a regular human, she is both uncomfortable and inaudible when wearing a mouthguard of some variety:  Let’s finish with her David After Dentist moment, because this one is a treat:  Maybe she’ll get the Insta-fame she deserves, or maybe she won’t. I don’t care, but now the ball is in your court. [source:buzzfeed] Do you have something awesome to share with the world?
