Italy veteran defender, Leonardo Bonucci has charged the Azzurri to learn from England, as they look to climb back to the top. England and Italy put up unfavorable displays at the last World Cup in Brazil, crashing out at the group stages. The Three Lions are back in Russia for the 2018 World Cup, but Italy failed to qualify for the showpiece event. Bonucci will be in the squad to face England in a friendly match in Wembley on Tuesday, and he wants Italy to learn from the young Three Lions. “We all need to understand Italy starts… not from zero, but not very far from zero,” Bonucci told reporters in Monday’s press conference, speaking as one of the elder statesmen in a team that since that qualifying disappointment has received an injection of new blood under interim coach Luigi Di Biagio. “We need to let these young players grow and hopefully they’ll take us back to the Italy we’re used to. “England have managed to go through transition while still qualifying. England have a group of young players with lots of experience. Our young players don’t have that experience. “There’s no point looking back. We should look forward. We have a team with not much international experience. You can’t compare our younger players to the English ones.” The post Bonucci: Italy Should Learn From England appeared first on 360Nobs.com.
