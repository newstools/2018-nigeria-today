Health workers under the aegis of the Joint Health Sector Unions (JOHESU) have threatened a nationwide industrial action if the Federal Government fails to meet an agreement it reached with the union on 30th of September, 2017 that led to the suspension of the previous strike action. JOHESU National Vice Chairman Dr Ogbonna Obinna Chimela while speaking to newsmen yesterday said a major high point of the agreement was the adjustment of CONHESS, a pay structure which the union is seeking adjustments. According to Dr. Chimel; ““If by April 17 our requests are not met, top of which is adjusted CONHESS, we shall have no other recourse than to down tools.” “We don’t want the masses to suffer, that was why we gave government the 30-day ultimatum,” he said.
