Bitcoin cash price is under pressure below $975 against the US Dollar. BCH/USD may continue to decline towards $850 and $800 support levels. This past week pushed bitcoin cash price in a bearish zone below $1,000 the US Dollar. There was a sharp downside move and the price settled below the $1,000 level and the 100 simple moving average (4-hours). There was a decline towards the $850 level and a low formed at $867. A recovery was initiated and the price moved above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the last decline from the $1,160 high to $867 low. However, the upside wave was protected by the $1,050 level. Moreover, the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the last decline from the $1,160 high to $867 low acted as a hurdle. At the moment, the price is trading lower and is well below the $950 level. On the upside, there is a crucial bearish trend line forming with resistance at $975 on the 4-hours chart of the BCH/USD pair. It seems like the pair may continue to decline and it could even break the $900 level in the near term.  Further below $900, the last low of $867 could be tested. Moreover, there is a risk of a test of $850, which is a major support zone.
