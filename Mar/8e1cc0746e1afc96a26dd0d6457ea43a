The last time we wrote about the Varsity Cup or the Varsity Shield, we were talking about some really ugly scenes playing out in Port Elizabeth. The Varsity Cup match between Shimlas and Madibaz was called off after violence erupted, and a mascot was even involved in a scuffle with one of the protesters. You can see those videos here, but let’s move on to Monday’s night Varsity Shield showdown between UKZN and CPUT. UKZN might have won a close match 34-29, but it was the dance-off between their mascot and a fan that is really worth mentioning. It wasn’t just any shuffle battle, though, because it’s a gqom dance-off. If you don’t know what this is, you can find a handy compilation here. Times LIVE with the deets of what to look out for: Right, we’re all prepped to see the video that Varsity Shield shared on Twitter:  Damn, that boy got moves. And sure, we’ll give the guy with the yellow backpack five points for effort. [source:timeslive] Do you have something awesome to share with the world?
