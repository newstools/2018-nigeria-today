By Adeyinka Ademola When yearning flew across the night sky
It twisted around the fingers
And left behind a beautiful image
like a dream When infinite cherry blossoms fall A tread of sadness and regret sweep across me
As I remembered that feeling so much hurt,
so much resentment, so much pain
So much love, so much hate, so much mess
One whose love is too insane
That’s willful squander Every reconciliation after a fight
We hug, kiss wildly and surrender
One whose love is not mad,
is not fit to say they have loved
before I am not asking for tomorrow,
eternity or a future
Your glance lights up this moment with me
