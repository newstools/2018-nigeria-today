Has a Thursday ever felt more like a Friday? I don’t have the time or energy to conduct such research, and if I was to hazard a guess I’d say I probably felt the same way this time last year. Whatever, let’s just be happy for one another. So as per Thursday tradition we’re throwing back to days of old, although this time it’s less chuckle and more recoil. During his time as Cliff Huxtable on The Cosby Show, which spent five consecutive seasons as the number-one rated show on television, Bill played the role of head of the family. There are plenty of clips that haven’t aged well, but this one is generally acclaimed as the worst-aged of the lot. If you’re familiar with his standard rape modus operandi, you’ll know why:  I reckon some of the highest ranked comments on the YouTube video just about nail this one: In case you’re wondering no, Bill Cosby is not behind bars, and is free to pop in jazz bars wearing shirts that say “Hello Friends”. This happened back in January, when he visited Philadelphia’s LaRose Jazz Club and performed an impromptu act.  Absolute creep. He will stand trial again on April 2, so here’s hoping he spends the rest of his days behind bars. Happy long weekend, everyone. Do you have something awesome to share with the world?
