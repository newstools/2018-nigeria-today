You had me at Mila Kunis. Also that ex’s name is Justin Theroux – we just wanted to see how it felt to refer to a man by his connection to a woman for a change. Last time we featured the delightful Mila was for a Thowback Thursday, when her and rookie BBC reporter Chris Stark combined for a truly memorable interview. Enough about that, because let’s look forward at what The Spy Who Dumped Me has in store for us. Also starring Kate McKinnon [above], Gillian Anderson, Hasan Minhaj, Ivanna Sakhno and Sam Heughan, here’s a brief synopsis from IMDb: As long as Liam Neeson doesn’t pop up somewhere trying to rescue his daughter, because at this point it’s just bad parenting. Show me what you got, Mila and crew:  This one hits US cinemas on August 3. [source:imdb] Do you have something awesome to share with the world?
