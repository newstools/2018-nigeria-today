It’s all about “creative new ideas for teachers and students”, but no one has any idea what exactly Apple will be focusing on. All will be revealed on March 27 in Chicago, however, and in the meantime we will have to make do with the only hint we have been given: “let’s take a field trip” written on the invite [above]. So seeing as Apple won’t give us any further clues, we decided to check out what it is The Verge thinks could happen during Tuesday’s event: New iPads Classkit New MacBook and MacBook Air New Apple Pencil Sure, while everything you see above is an updated version of this or new version of that, if there’s one thing we know about Apple events it’s that, well, it’s incredibly hard to predict what will go down as the company is full of surprises. And another thing we know is that Apple cares about education. Every year, Digicape offers tertiary students, educators, lecturers and faculty staff the opportunity to save big on MacBooks:  You can check their awesome deals here and here, and if you’re worried about dropping the cash all at once, Digicape offers an incredible Flexible Finance solution, which assists you with affording the latest Apple products with personalised finance from accredited institutions. In the meantime, we wait with bated breath for Tuesday’s event. [source:theverge] Do you have something awesome to share with the world?
