  As he rounds off his 30billionAfrica tour, hip hop singer David Adeleke, popularly known as Davido, has turned prayer warrior. On Thursday, he posted a video on Instagram in which he and his crew could be seen holding hands while he led what looked like a prayer session. “Nobody will injure in Jesus’ name,” Davido prayed after what seemed to be the Niamey, Niger concert. “It will be successful in Jesus’ name I pray. As we go back to Lagos, as we finish this tour, it will be successful in Jesus’ name.” He also wished his official DJ, DJ ECool, a happy birthday as the video segued into his performance on Wednesday. In the video, Davido could be seen prancing the stage and at one climbing the trusses. The ‘FIA’ crooner also disclosed that the next and final stop of the 30billionAfricatour before returning to Lagos is Dakar, Senegal.
