President Muhammadu Buhari and his party the ruling All Progressives Congress APC seem to be heading for a deadlock over the tenure elongation of party chairman Odigie John Oyegun. It would be recalled that President Buhari had expressed reservations over the tenure elongation of Oyegun which was ratified at the party’s last National Executive Committee NEC meeting. But party spokesperson Bolaji Abdullahi while speaking to the edia late Tuesday said the president was only expressing a personal opinion which does not supersede that of the NEC of the party. “The president’s position has not changed the position of NEC. NEC has not reversed itself on the tenure extension. The decision of the NEC on the one-year tenure extension still stands. “The president is not NEC. The NEC will have to reverse itself but right now, it has not done that. So, the tenure extension still stands,” he said.   Do you have something awesome to share with the world?
