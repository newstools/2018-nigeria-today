According to TMZ, power couple, Jay Z and Beyonce are in Jamaica to shoot a video content that will be used for their upcoming On the Run II Tour. Jay Z and Beyonce are spotted cruising along the famous Trenchtown where the music legend, Bob Marley lived for a while and always sang about. The couple will be shooting at Tuff Gong, Bob Marley’s home, and studio. Jay was on Jamrock just last year … when he recorded with Damian Marley for the 4:44 album.  With the tour which is set to kick off in June 2018, it is obvious the power couple have put aside all the cheating drama and are moving on. It would be recalled that back in November 2017, while granting an interview with Dean Baquet from The New York Times, Jay Z explained why he cheated on Beyonce and how they both used therapy to avoid divorce.
