Presidential spokesperson, Femi Adesina says president Muhammadu Buhari may not necessarily know everything that is happening in Nigeria. He disclosed this on Tuesday on Sunrise Daily a programme on Channels Television. “The president may not know everything. He didn’t know that the Inspector general of police allegedly left Benue after one day but he got to know yesterday. So there are some things you can’t hide forever. So yes, the president may not know everything.” He said He noted that president Buhari is still waiting to hear from the inspector general of police before taking a final decision. “They were in the realm of allegations until the key stakeholders mentioned it yesterday. They were just allegations as far as I’m concerned. “Even now, they are still in the realm of allegations until we hear from the IGP. “I’m aware of it but I did not know the length of time he stayed in Benue before moving to Nasarawa.”  Do you have something awesome to share with the world?
