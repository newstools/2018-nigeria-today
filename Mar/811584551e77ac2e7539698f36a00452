The senate today received a petition from one of its members accusing Kogi state governor Yahaya Bello of forming an illegal vigilante group set to usurp the powers of security agencies in the state. The law according to Senator Dino Melaye is in conflict with the provisions of the constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. ‘This law, Mr. President alters the function of the Nigeria Police as stipulated in section 214 of the constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 as amended’. ‘Mr. President, it is a fact that states can make laws through the state houses of Assembly as enshrined in section 4 of the1999 constitution as amended. But the laws they must make must not be in conflict with the provision of the constitution’. ‘Mr. President, I seek your indulgence to read a section of the law passed by Kogi state government. It says, the vigilante group will be involved in the detection and prevention of crime, the apprehension of criminal, the preservation of law and order, the protection of life and property, will assist other security and para-military agencies in the discharge of their duty, to assist other security agencies in government installation, to assist other security agencies in maintaining law and order in any economic, political and social gathering. ”There shall be a comptroller-general of vigilante services and, deputy comptroller-general of vigilante services,” he said. Melaye cited the new law as a justification for the illegal import of army camouflage uniform, which was recently seized in the state.   .  Do you have something awesome to share with the world?
