Jack Wilshere’s return to the England national team has been delayed by injury, which will now rule out of Friday night’s friendly with the Netherlands. Jack Wilshere was due to feature for England at the Amsterdam ArenA, ending his near-two-year exile from the side since Euro 2016. Speaking to reporters at Thursday’s press conference, however, England boss Gareth Southgate revealed that Wilshere did not travel with the rest of his teammates because of a minor injury problem. “It is not a specific injury and over time they flare up and they need to settle down over a couple of days,” he said. “We are hopeful it will settle down pretty quickly. It’s an ongoing problem and it’s not something new for him. “He’s very disappointed not to be involved in the game. He’s trained well though but if you think about the journey he’s had in the last two years and his big injuries then he’s progressing really well.” The post Jack Wilshere Out Of Friendly Match Vs Netherlands Due To Injury appeared first on 360Nobs.com.
