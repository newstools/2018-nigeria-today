Oh dear. It’s been a long while since we last saw Taylor Swift but, well, what she has on offer for us this time around is nothing that original. Too harsh? Perhaps, but the dance moves in her new music video for “Delicate”- her fourth single from Reputation – are obviously channeling Sia’s favourite Maddie Ziegler just a little too much. Creepy smile included. The music video’s theme is something along the lines of “dance like nobody’s watching”, and shows that if Swift had to be invisible for the day, she would pretty much dance like Ziegler, reports Mashable: Everyone dreams of being invisible, but I guess that’s especially the case for the 28-year-old pop star whose last two years in the spotlight have been nothing to be envious about.
