Minister of Information, Lai Mohammed has described how he and others have benefitted from a former governor of Lagos state and the national leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Asiwaju Bola Tinubu. He disclosed this while speaking at the 10th Bola Tinubu Colloquium and his 66th birthday celebration held at the Eko Hotel, Lagos. According to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), Mohammed explained how Tinubu made him his chief of staff when he (Tinubu) was the governor of Lagos state even when he was not from Lagos state. He said currently, there are so many Tinubu boys working in the presidency. “Not being from Lagos state, many people found it strange for him to have made me his Chief of staff. “Today, I can say boldly that at least in the federal cabinet, we have those occupying positions who had served in his cabinet at one time or the other. “We have the vice president, myself, the minister of power works and housing, Raji Fashola and the minister of solid minerals Development, Kayode Fayemi. “If you also look at governor in many states today whether it is Osun or elsewhere, they had worked with him in one capacity or the other” Do you have something awesome to share with the world?
