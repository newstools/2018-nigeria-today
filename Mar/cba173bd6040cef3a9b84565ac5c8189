Nigerian singer, Simi had an amusing banter with her mother on Instagram earlier today. The beautiful singer took to her I.G page to share cute photos of her looking stunning in an off-shoulder top. Her mum who also follows her on Instagram saw it and fell in love with the top. She asked her to bring it for her when next sheâ€™s going home, so she too could slay in it for her newly married husband.  The Joromi crooner gave her an adorable response that everyone can relate to. See screenshot below;   The post Between Simi And Her Mother On Instagram appeared first on 360Nobs.com.
