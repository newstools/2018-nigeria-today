We often feature VICE on 2OV, and usually they’re dealing with drugs or drama relating to America. It’s the same story on VICE Sports, minus the drugs, but now they’ve focused their attention on our own Temba Bavuma. The Proteas might have given the Ozzies a working over in Port Elizabeth, with Kagiso Rabada running riot, but Theunis de Bruyn hasn’t exactly made that number six berth his own. The stage is set for Temba to return to the team for the third test, having battled back from a finger injury, and in case you had forgotten what his rise to the top entailed consider this a timely reminder. Here’s the VICE Sports write-up: That century, after Ben Stokes told him he wasn’t good enough for international cricket, still gives me goosebumps. Take it away, big man:  Jislaaik, there’s a moment for every South African cricket fan to remember fondly. Hey Temba, fancy making another ton against the Ozzies in the third test, with a Warner run-out for good measure?  [source:vicesports] Do you have something awesome to share with the world?
