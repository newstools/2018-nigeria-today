Well that didn’t go as planned, hey Malusi? Twitter is ruthless, and the ex-Finance Minister and current dead man walking Home Affairs Minister Malusi Gigaba should know that. Seems it slipped his mind when he decided to post this video on Twitter earlier today, calling out a Home Affairs employee filmed being rather lax on the job. The video had done the rounds on social media, and Gigaba stated that he has asked the Department of Home Affairs to investigate this matter and take swift action against the official.  Pretty poor on the official’s front, but isn’t Malusi forgetting something? That’s right – remember when he was busted playing Candy Crush during Parliament? Twitter never forgets:  Drag him. I could go on, because there are plenty of other people sticking the knife in, but I think the point has been made. Gigaba currently has his hands full, giving evidence to the parliamentary committee investigating State Capture. News24 reckon his political career has taken a turn for the worse: Then there is his Gupta citizenship folly, which we can only hope is the final nail in his coffin. President Ramaphosa, you know what to do. [sources:capetalk&news24] Do you have something awesome to share with the world?
