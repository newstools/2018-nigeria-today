Christophe Dugarry, who won the World Cup with France, believes Kylian Mbappe is a modern day Zinedine Zidane. Dugarry was in the same squad with Zidane, when he headed in two goals in the 3-0 win over Brazil in 1998. Dugarry believes Mbappe can be talismanic, if he plays in his favourite position of centre forward. “For a long time, I’ve thought that Mbappe must be the forward for France,” he told RMC. “It’s sure because it’s his best position. He can play well on te right or the left, but the boy is a centre forward and must be France’s spearhead for the next 10 or 15 years. He’s a No.9. “He’s our Michel Platini, our Zinedine Zidane. He’s the player for our future. So he must be allowed to learn and mature in this position.” “A duet with Griezmann would be wonderful,” he continued. “It’s the essence of football. They could go in behind, play off each other, they could play in small spaces. It would be like Romario and Bebeto and I think that would be perfect.” The post Dugarry: Mbappe Is Our Zidane appeared first on 360Nobs.com. Do you have something awesome to share with the world?
