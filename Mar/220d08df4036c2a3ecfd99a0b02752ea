Billionaire oil mogul, Femi Otedola, has set the social media on fire, in a video he posted last night, dancing to Davido’s hit song, Omo Baba Lowo, with his daughters. Otedola, who joined Instagram on 9 February this year, to stem fake accounts, now has close to 90,000 followers and his latest video has attracted 104,000 views and over 1200 comments.  The billionaire did not state the reason for the dance, but the atmospherics of the video, with balloons and a cake on the table, shows the family was celebrating an event, possibly a birthday.
