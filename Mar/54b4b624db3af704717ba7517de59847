75-year-old Munich-based doctor, Mueller-Wohlfahrt says Pep Guardiola is often portrayed as an innovative if not revolutionary coach but at Bayern Munich, he turned the clock back. Mueller-Wohlfahrt who worked with Guardiola at Bayern Munich from 2013 until May 2016 in which Guardiola won three consecutive Bundesliga titles says Guardiola seems to live in constant fear. In his autobiography which is being serialised in newspaper Bild, Mueller-Wohlfahrt wrote: “Guardiola is often portrayed in the media as an innovative, if not revolutionary, coach, but at Bayern Munich he turned the clock back “It even went so far as to turn our medically thought-out, well-rehearsed warm-up programme on it’s head before training sessions. “I think Pep Guardiola is a person of low self-esteem. “He seems to live in constant fear, not so much of defeat, but much more about any loss of power and authority,” Do you have something awesome to share with the world?
