 Torino midfielder, Joel Obi, has returned to full training at his Serie A club, a week before Nigeria faces Poland in a pre-World Cup friendly. Torino wrote via its official website to inform that Obi participated in the club’s workout, which was held in Filadelfia, Calabria on Friday afternoon. Ahead of today’s league match at the Stadio Olimpico Grande Torino against Fiorentina, the Nigeria international was able to complete the entire training session without any issues. Obi has already sent in his travel itinerary and is expected to report at Radisson Hotel, Wroclaw, Poland, latest tomorrow. It would be his 22nd appearance for The Maroons in all competitions if he gets playing time against Fiorentina. Monaco loanee, Elderson Echiejile, has declared himself fit for the two friendlies after recovering from illness, while Tyronne Ebuehi of ADO Den Haag and Las Palmas’ Oghenekaro Etebo are on the road to recovery. The Super Eagles will battle Poland at the Municipal Stadium on March 23, before facing Serbia at the Hive Stadium in London four days later. Do you have something awesome to share with the world?
