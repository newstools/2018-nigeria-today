With barely a few months to the biggest sporting event on Earth – the 2018 FIFA World Cup – Jason Derulo has unveiled his exuberant new song “Colors,” which is expected to serve as one of the anthems for the upcoming soccer tournament in Russia. Previous World Cup anthems include Shakira’s 2010 single “Waka Waka” and 2014’s “Dar um Jeito (We Will Find a Way)” featuring Carlos Santana, Wyclef Jean and Avicii. It is understood that the song was selected by Coca-Cola as its official song of the tournament. It was announced in February that the American musician would take up the baton from Pitbull and Shakira before him in a collaboration with Coca-Cola for the upcoming tournament in Russia. After the song’s premiere, Derulo tweeted at Donald Trump, “We’re all united in the fact that we’re different” with the Haitian flag. The is because the singer’s parents hail from Haiti, one of the countries that the president infamously labeled a “shithole.“ Meanwhile, the Super Eagles, Nigeria’s national team, will be participating at the World Cup which begins June 14 in Russia.
