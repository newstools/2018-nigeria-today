A former Minister of Defense General Theophilus Danjuma on Saturday accused the Nigerian Armed forces of colluding with killer herdsmen on an ethnic cleansing agenda. Speaking yesterday at the maiden convocation of the Taraba State University (TSU), Jalingo, Taraba State, where he was presented with an Honorary Doctorate of Science Degree, Danjuma further urged Nigerians to defend themselves against killers in the country. According to the war veteran, the Military were providing cover for killer herdsmen unleashing terror on communities across the country. He called on the people to rise up and defend themselves, as relying on the armed forces to defend them was suicidal. Mr. Danjuma, who was Nigeria’s Minister of Defence from 1999 to 2003, warned that Nigeria risks suffering a fate such as that of Somalia if the killings are not checked.
