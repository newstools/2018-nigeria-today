Governor of Ekiti, Ayodele Fayose says he is not certain if president Buhari was aware that 110 Dapchi schoolgirls were abducted. The governor stated this while responding to a statement credited to president Muhammadu Buhari that ‘he was not aware that the Inspector General of Police, Ibrahim Idris, flouted his express directive to relocate to Benue State during the crisis in which scores of people were killed’. According to Fayose, if it took 2 months for president Buhari to know that his directive were flouted by IGP then it is very certain that he may not know the deatils of things happening around him, let alone Nigeria. In a statement via his twitter handle, Fayose admitted that with this new revelation , Nigeria is in serious problem.  What manner of a President will give order to the IGP on January 9, only to be telling Nigerians on March 12 (2 months after) that he never knew that the IGP disobeyed his order? Does this President really know anything about happenings around him, not to talk about Nigeria? — Peter Ayodele Fayose (@GovAyoFayose) March 12, 2018   Do you have something awesome to share with the world?
