Damn, but the desperation levels in this country are reaching ridiculous levels. Just the other day, walking down Long Street in the wee hours of the morning, a man casually put his hand in my sister’s bag. He wasn’t targeting anything specific, and neither was he aggressive, but it’s all getting a little too brazen. The latest video featuring an astonishing act of crime was recorded in late February, and shows a few tables outside fast-food chain RocoMamas in Randburg, reports News24: He makes his way back down the stairs and into a getaway car, of all things! All that effort for a phone? Take a look:  According to Randburg Police Station spokesperson, Captain Makgowanyana Maja, they had been notified about the incident at RocoMamas: Honestly, how vigilant must we become? It’s rather embarrassing when you flinch at anyone who walks past just a little too close for comfort. [source: news24] Do you have something awesome to share with the world?
