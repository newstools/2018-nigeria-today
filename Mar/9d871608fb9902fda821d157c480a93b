The People’s Democratic Party PDP has revealed that the south western region of the country remains a solid political base for the party and hence the need to hold its stakeholders in high esteem. Kola Ologbondiyan, the National Publicity Secretary of the party in a press statement issued on Monday when he played host to leaders of the Federation of South-West Professionals in Politics said the party over the years has learnt not to treat matters concerning the zone with levity. “The South-West zone is a major support base of the PDP. It is very strategic to our party and we hold our leaders and members in the zone in very high esteem for their untiring efforts in ensuring that the PDP flag continues to fly high in spite of daunting challenges. “Due to their resilience, our party held forth, so much so, that despite the manipulations and intimidations by the All Progressives Congress (APC), in 2015, the difference in votes won by the APC and our great party in the southwest was very minimal. That shows that PDP commands the genuine followership of voters in the region. He cited instances of states where the party holds sway such states reveal the formidable nature of the party. “In Lagos state, the home of the national leader of the APC, the PDP won six House of Representatives seats and nine state assembly seats. We have continued to have the majority support of the voting population in Ekiti state and our structure in the southwest in general remains formidable. “In Oyo State, our party is waxing stronger while our victory at the last senatorial election in Osun West has shown that we shall retake the state,” he said.
