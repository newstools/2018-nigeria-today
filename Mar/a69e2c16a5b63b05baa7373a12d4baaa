The former Super Eagles coach said that the technical directors on continent last year met in Rabat, Morroco, to see how to raise the standard. “Our coaching certificates are not recognised in Europe and Asia because of low standard; CAF wants to improve the standard to meet with standards in Europe and elsewhere,’’ he said.
