By Abel Udoekene President Muhammadu Buhari says the tenure elongation of John Odigie Oyegun led National working committee of the All Progressive Congress was against the party and the Nigerian constitution. Buhari disclosed this on Tuesday before the commencement of NEC meeting of the APC according to a report by the Daily Post “it is against the party and the Nigerian constitution.” Buhari stated Recalled that the NEC of the APC on February 28 had extended the tenure of John Oyegun led National Working Committee (NWC) by one year. Nigeria Today source gathered that this may be connected to the faceoff between a National leader of the party Bola Tinubu and the National Chairman of the party, John Oyegun. According to the source, the presidency has lost faith in the ability of John Oyegun to steer the leadership of the party to victory in 2019. The source wondered why Oyegun as the chairman of the party failed to intervene in the conflict at Kano, Kaduna and Benue state chapter of the party. According to him “If he failed to resolve a little conflict like between Bello and Melaye, El-rufai and Sani, Ganduje and Kwankwaso, how do you think such a man can convince Nigerians to vote Buhari at this critical time in our political history” The source disclosed that the presidency was already thinking of a former governor of Edo state, Adam Oshiomole as a replacement.
