By Emmanuel Elebeke ABUJA—AHEAD of 2019 general elections, the Prelate of the Eternal Sacred Order of the Cherubim and Seraphim, ESOCS, Worldwide, His Eminence, the Baba Aladura, David Bob-Manuel, has charged political leaders in the country to rule in righteousness, fear of God and service to humanity. The prelate, who made the call while on his Episcopal visit to Abuja on Sunday, stressed that it had become imperative for political leaders to show patriotism and work for the good of the land and the prosperity of the nation. He therefore called for introspection and return to God for the glory of the nation to be restored. He said: “I want to admonish leaders of our land to rule in righteousness and in the fear of God and to work for the good of the land and prosperity of our nation. “If we return to God and let righteousness flourish in our land, God will heal our nation, restore peace in the land and everything would turn around for good.” The post 2019: Prelate tasks politicians on selfless service appeared first on Vanguard News.
