Global Professional service company KPMG is set to boost child literacy in Nigeria, through the KPMG’s Family for Literacy (KFFL) programme in Nigeria. The initiative according to the group seeks to eradicate childhood illiteracy by putting new books into the hands of children in need and developing the next generation of young leaders through reading. Global Head of Citizenship, KPMG International, Lord Michael Hastings while making an address at the inaugural edition of the outreach in St Jude’s Nursery and Primary School Oyingbo Lagos state said the company had also launched similar initiatives in some other parts of the world. “The books we are going to give today are yours; they are our gifts to you. We want you to keep, read them over and over again with your friends and family so you can keep your mind rich.” “The reason we are here is because KPMG launched this literacy programme in the United States of America and now we have spread it to Mexico, China, Kenya, Uganda Tanzania and we have also spread it to South Africa, India, Europe and here we are now in Nigeria which we are launching in Nigeria today,” he said.
