 Esther Khissa, a waitress at Twins Center bar in Mutungo, has become the next lucky winner of an all-expense paid trip to watch the World Cup live in Russia in Nile Special’s ongoing “Tulumbe Russia” campaign. Khissa, whose joy was palpable as she was officially unveiled winner, is the 3rd individual to win a ticket to Russia. The first ticket was won by Pius Ogena, a local rugby player while the second was won by Edson Kakumirizi. Launched in late April, the campaign will see 10 lucky consumers across the country win fully paid trips to Russia. There are also several other goodies including TVs, and Kwese decoders among others to be won. To stand a chance to win, consumers should text a code under the Nile special crown to 8008 or log onto the Nile Special website. The “Tulumbe Russia” campaign will run for a month ending on May 25th. Meanwhile, Nile Special is the first truly Ugandan brand to be associated with the FIFA World Cup.
