Over a year of silence after his previous releases, Muno, also known as Munosings and “da Voice,” is back with a new one, this one titled, “I Dey Hail.” The song depicts the strength and hustle of every Nigerian youth and Africa at large, encouraging and giving them hope in themselves and their craft. It is for that young man with dreams, tired but not relenting, that young girl with a passion who no one believes in but is forging ahead, that mother praying and wishing her children will put a smile on her face, for you on the streets asking for daily bread… Muno says “God Go Do Something” https://www.bellanaija.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/I-dey-hail.mp3 The post Muno returns with new single “I Dey Hail” | Listen on BN appeared first on BellaNaija – Nigeria breaking & top news to the World 24/7.
