We’ve heard about people who have been married to serial killers and never known about the crimes their spouses have committed, so maybe Georgina Chapman didn’t know about husband Harvey’s serial sexual abuse. Chapman has kept a low profile since the news broke, and the last time we heard her name in the news it was to do with the whopping impending divorce settlement. Rumoured to be around $11,25 million to $20 million, in case you were wondering. Now Chapman has broken her silence, speaking to Vogue about life after Harvey, and if you’re into celeb life then this is right up your alley. It being Vogue, there’s plenty of fashion talk and such: Ah yes, the simple veal Milanese and eggplant parmigiana lunch. Commoners. Right, drama: Apparently, at some point they also went to the seashore:  I’ll skip ahead to this passage, which shows just how embarrassed and ashamed she is about human toad Harvey’s actions: I wonder if she kept up to date with all those horrific allegations from Harvey’s old personal assistants? The interview is long, in-depth, and covers her entire relationship with Harvey from back when they first met. If that’s your jam, you can go right ahead and read it here. I’m still shook from that lunch order. [source:vogue]   Follow us on twitter @NigeriaTodayNG Also, Like us on facebook This post was syndicated from 2oceansvibe.com.
