Nigeria Scrabble Federation  has  suspended a player, Cyprian Awah, for four years on account of a violation of its rules and regulations.
Akintunde Akinsemola, Chairman of NSF’s Publicity Committee, said in a statement that the suspension was in accordance with the decision of the federation’s Disciplinary Committee.
Akinsemola said: “NSF took the decision as a result of proven repeated allegations of impersonation, falsification of results and forgery against Awah over the years.’’
Akinsemola further disclosed that Awah has also been given two weeks to refund his first runners-up prize money, received by default at Ushakaa Scrabble Tourney in Makurdi, Benue.
He said: “He received that money on March 25. Failure to refund within this period can lead to an indefinite ban from the scrabble sport in Nigeria and a probable prosecution by the law enforcement agencies.’’
The NSF spokesman also said the federation reaffirmed the indefinite suspension of Kabiru Olaiya, one of Nigeria’s representatives at the 2017 World English Language Scrabble Championship in Kenya.
He said: “Olaiya is guilty of not remitting the percentage due to NSF from his prize money at the Nairobi tournament.’’
Akinsemola said all suspended scrabble players have been barred, following these decisions, from showing up at or commenting on NSF-sanctioned competitions.
He said: “NSF will not spare any player or official found guilty of bringing the intellectually-inclined game of scrabble into disrepute.’’   Follow us on twitter @NigeriaTodayNG Also, Like us on facebook This post was syndicated from Nigerian Pilot News.
