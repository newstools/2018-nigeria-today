 Ripple price is slowly recovering against the US Dollar and Bitcoin. XRP/USD must close above $0.8100 to gain traction and correct further higher towards $0.8400. During the past few days, we saw a major decline from the $0.8800 swing in Ripple price against the US Dollar. The price even broke the $0.8000 and $0.7800 support levels this week to move into a bearish zone. It traded as low as $0.7610 recently where buyers appeared. Later, the price started an upside correction and moved above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the last drop from the $0.8454 high to $0.7610 low. The most important move was a break above this week’s highlighted crucial bearish trend line with resistance at $0.8010 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The pair even traded a few points above the $0.8000 level. However, the upside move was capped by the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the last drop from the $0.8454 high to $0.7610 low. It is currently moving lower and is testing the previous resistance (now support) at $0.7920. If the price fails to stay above the $0.7920-00 levels, it could decline back towards $0.7600.
