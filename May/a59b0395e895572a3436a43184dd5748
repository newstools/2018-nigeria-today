Evan Moore is a brave man who knows how to handle a kayak, so here’s a shout out to his latest video. He’s dubbed it ‘Royal Flush’, and it involves him cascading down a series of waterfalls on California’s Royal Gorge, a three-day section on the North Fork of the American River. The Inertia reports that this is a particularly tough run, but looks like it’s all in a day’s work for Evan. Enjoy from the safety of your desk:  Well played, sir.
