Better start putting your cigarettes out and packing your pipes away, South African smokers. According to this new draft law, you could be jailed up to three months for smoking in public. The draft Control of Tobacco Products and Electronic Delivery Systems Bill (Cotped), which was gazetted on Wednesday, intends to ban smoking in all enclosed public spaces, enclosed workplaces and in vehicles with passengers, reports Business Insider SA. It also includes the removal of dedicated smoking areas in restaurants. So if you’re caught for smoking out in the open, your busted ass is spending three months jail. That sentence could be extended to a year if your employees are unwillingly exposed to smoking. If you’re in the tobacco manufacturing business, you could risk receiving a five-year sentence if you don’t remove all branding on packages, with an exception to the company’s logo. But wait, there’s more: Other key provisions in the draft Bill include: As you can already tell, the Bill basically defeats the purpose of even smoking in the first place. Not that I’m complaining, ’cause tobacco can be unhealthy for smokers and non-smokers alike, you know. But that’s none of my business, I suppose *sips tea*. Still, members of the public have until August 9 to comment on the draft legislation before it goes to the National Assembly for adoption. Comments should be sent to lynn.moeng@health.gov.za. Better start hiding those ciggie boxes and lighters, folks. [source:businessinsidersa]   Follow us on twitter @NigeriaTodayNG Also, Like us on facebook This post was syndicated from 2oceansvibe.com.
