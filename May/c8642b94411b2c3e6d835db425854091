Every day on the Nigerian internet, there are people who keep our eyes glued to our phone screens as we read their rants, opinions, perspectives on political and social matters, etc. Sometimes, they are just downright ridiculous. We make it our job to take down the names of these noisemakers. Here’s our list from today: 1. Wizkid  Someone cannot ask for something in peace again, See Davido shaking this table (maybe it’s already broken sef)  Then…  That is how play play will turn to the real thing. 2. Wofaifada  Go on babe!!! 3. Badt Boi  But… isn’t it cheaper if the bank maintains it? Especially since there are other things like oil and oil filter yet to be bought? What we should be asking: “Why do we have to pay a lot of money to get the card and still pay everytime to maintain it?” 4. Marrgarritah  Tell ‘them’, tell them oo! 5. Oby Ezekwesili  It is not just you oo! The days are running away from us in Nigeria. 6. Francis Agoda  Commendable! Really. Let’s stop waiting for the government to do basically everything. We can do little things in our little way that will translate to GREATER GOOD. 7. Yung 6ix  8. Telo  You know that emoji you use? That one now. Where the person opens his/her palms to the sky. Use it now, twice – for emphasis.
