By Lawani Mikairu lagos—The Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority, NCAA, weekend suspended the Air Operators Certificate, AOC, of First Nation Airways indefinitely over “unauthorised and illegal operations”. NCAA Spokesman, Sam Adurogboye, said in a statement that the suspension was conveyed to the airline via a letter with reference No. NCAA/DG/CSLA/RM/1-06/18/2304 and dated May 11, 2018 and signed by the Agency’s Director General, Capt. Muhtar Usman. He said the letter had been delivered to First Nation Airways and the airline had acknowledged receipt. Adurogboye said:”The suspension is sequel to the flagrant and continuous violation of the terms and conditions of issuance of its AOC by the airline thereby carrying out unauthorised and illegal operations. The letter revealed that when the AOC of First Nation Airways expired, the airline did not have at least two airworthy aircraft capable of servicing its approved schedule as required by Part 9.1.1.6(b)(2) (ii) of Nigerian Civil Aviation Regulation (Nig.CARS) 2015. “Consequently, the airline’s Air Operators Certificate (AOC) was, upon renewal, restricted to non-scheduled operation, (Charter) only.” According to him, the airline however embarked on scheduled operations with continuous advertisement of its services and sold tickets at its check-in counters in Lagos and Abuja Airports. He said NCAA had ”earlier notified the airline that it was investigating these violations.” The post NCAA suspends First Nation Airways indefinitely for illegal operations appeared first on Vanguard News.
