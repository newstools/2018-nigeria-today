My word, this is going to rile those American evangelical Trump supporters. (Not his serial cheating or lack of basic human decency, though, because that doesn’t seem to matter at all.) Way back in 2002, before she had done the deed with Donald, Stormy Daniels posed as the Virgin Mary during a shoot with artist Nika Nesgoda. She wasn’t the only adult film star to do so, because Nesgoda recreated a number of iconic paintings of the Virgin Mary using adult film actors as models. We’ll look at Stormy’s pic first:  Pretty lowkey, really. Back then Stormy was just another adult film actress, but of course that’s all changed over the past few months. She’s even headlining Saturday Night Live these days, issuing stern warnings to the president. TIME nailed it here: Let’s look at a few others from the artist’s series, and bonus points if you can name the adult film actress:    Do your research on your own time. Nesgoda was pretty taken with Stormy from the start: That’s exactly what drew Donald to her, you know. Well, that and some of her other assets.
