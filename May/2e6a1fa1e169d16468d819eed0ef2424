The fast growing slums
in Abuja, the nationâ€™s capital
appears not to be worrisome
to the authorities. There are
fears that rather than the
federal capital city develops
and expands to cater for
Nigerians; the shanties are
growing rapidly and could
in the nearest future overrun
the seat of government.
Our correspondent, Friday
Obande, takes a critical
look at the worrying trend,
especially Gishiri, a squalor
that is fast encroaching on
the city center
The rapid growth and
expansion of slums around
the city centers in Abuja FCT,
is becoming quite alarming.
A tour towards Katampe,
Asokoro and Garki, which
areas are within 250 square
kilometers of the city centers
unravel unimaginable
slums around elegant
houses and infrastructure.
Evidently, some of the
developing areas in Abuja
like Kubwa, Lugbe, Nyanya,
Karu and other mapped
out areas around the city
centre are fast reclining to
underdevelopment with
the encroachment of these
exploding slums. Apart
from the Central Business
District and Wuse which are
yet the only unaffected areas
in the FCT, Nigerian Pilot
Weekend findings reveal
that every other district in
the capital city has sordid
slums that present an ugly
picture of Abuja, a city once
thought to be the fastest
growing capital territory in
Africa.
Moving from Mabushi
through the Nnamdi
Azikiwe Express Way to
Mpape, into Nicon Junction,
there is a small but densely
populated village, Gishiri, a
sloppy slum that is hidden
behind bogus duplexes.
Gishiri is sheltered
between Katampe, Jahi,
Mabushi and Mpape and
constitutes part of the
cartography of the Abuja
Municipal Area Council, AMAC.
Like every other narratives
associated with the
encroachment of slums in
Abuja city centers, Gishri
village is a neighboring
environ directly opposite
Maitama district, the location
of Transcorp Hilton and it
is one of the fastest growing
cosmopolitan shanties in the
FCT with a population of over
80,000 people. The village is
originally a Gbagyi settlement
and basically, the economic
mainstay of people revolves
around farming, trading and
artisanship which a large
percentage of the populace in
the area depend on as sources
of livelihood.
One bizarre but unique
quality of Gishiri is the sloppy
but beautiful landscape
that curdles the market-like
shanties of the area in warm
embrace. This vision of rocks
and highlands gives the
settlement a unique outlook
mostly at night time when the
surrounding rocks exhume the
chillness of the atmosphere,
giving the horizon the sight of
a beautiful dungeon covered
with filths from huge piles
of refuse dumps that ooze
out harmful stench into the
atmosphere.
Gishiri is a fertile area in
terms of agriculture and there
is a considerable expanse of
land max housing cashew,
orange and mango orchard of
large economic value, located
behind the residential parts
of the village. These trees also
serve as seasonal mainstay
for the locals, as well as
arable lands for farming and
grazing for cattle.
The village is populated
with more of congested mud
or corrugated iron sheeted
structures for houses and
most of the rooms are less
than 12 feet wide, with
earthen floor finishing for
most of the buildings. Also,
a considerable number of
these houses are normally
poorly ventilated in most
cases, creating difficulty
for residents to open their
windows for the terrible
stench from dirty stagnant
water that gush out of broken
out of either suck-away or
the enormous heaps of refuse   Follow us on twitter @NigeriaTodayNG Also, Like us on facebook This post was syndicated from Nigerian Pilot News. Click here to read the full text on the original website.
