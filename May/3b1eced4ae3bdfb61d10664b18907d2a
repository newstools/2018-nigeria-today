A former Ekiti state governor Prince Segun Oni, has denied rumours that he might dump the ruling All Progressives Congress APC no matter the outcome of the party governorship primaries. Oni said he had no doubt he will emerge as the party’s flagbearer and that he had no other plans outside the APC. He added that people should expect rumours and political propaganda at a time when the primary election is fast approaching. “As far as I am concerned, my name is Engineer Olusegun Adebayo Oni and my Plan A is APC. Plan B is APC. Plan C is APC and up to Z. My plan is APC. Why should I exercise fears when I know that by the grace of God, I will win at the primary election? “I strongly believe that APC will take over governance in Ekiti State in a matter of time. I want to appeal to our delegates to shun money bags and they should never be deceived with financial inducement during the primaries. They should vote based on their conscience and on performance index,” he advised.   Follow us on twitter @NigeriaTodayNG Also, Like us on facebook
