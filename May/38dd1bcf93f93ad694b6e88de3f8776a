Mr Femi Falana (SAN) has said the Senate got it wrong when it asked the President, or the Inspector General of Police to appear before it. He said this when he appeared as a guest on Channels Television’s breakfast programme, Sunrise Daily, on Thursday. Falana quoted sections of the Constitution to explain that the President or the governor of a state cannot be summoned by the National Assembly.
