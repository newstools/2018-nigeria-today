Nigeria’s Vice President Professor Yemi Osinbao says if the country does not deal with the issues of corruption, it would be difficult to guarantee economic prosperity for the country. Prof. Osinbajo made the comments yesterday when he played host to the World Bank Group Executive Director for Italy, Mr Patrizio Pagano at the Presidential Villa, Abuja. He asserted that if the country continue to allow resources to be pilfered and wasted, then the whole idea of economic prosperity will be difficult. “There is a tendency to assume that if we get just a number of things right in our micro-economic planning, for instance, to promote trade and so on, we would be able to deal with the issues of poverty through a trickle down policy. “But unfortunately, here, this is not necessarily the case. We might get the micro issues right and still have the problems, especially of poverty. “In terms of systematic policy, you have to keep innovating, looking for what works, tweaking it here and there. “Also, if you don’t deal with issues around corruption, it becomes difficult. If we allow resources to be pilfered and wasted, then the whole idea of economic prosperity is difficult. “So we have programmes and initiatives in place that promote accountability, like Treasury Single Account (TSA), and other policies,” he said. According to the Vice President N500 billion had been set aside for the Social Investment Programme which is an important statement for the government to address the question of inclusivity. “So, the question for us is how to ensure inclusion or inclusivity, how to get millions of our very poor people into the economy, how to structure our budget in such a way that recognises that. “That is why we set up the N500 billion Social Investment Programmes. “Though we are not spending anything near that yet, it is an important statement for us to address the question of inclusivity,’’ he stated..
