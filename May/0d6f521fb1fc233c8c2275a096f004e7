It’s time to break out the tissues, or the sicks bags, if romance movies aren’t your thing. But if you find Pablo Escobar fascinating, then I suppose you gotta take the bad with the … good? Bad? Whatever. Universal has debuted the official US trailer for the film Loving Pablo. Directed by Spanish filmmaker Fernando León de Aranoa, Loving Pablo is a romantic thriller about the Colombian journalist Virginia Vallejo who enters a passionate, doomed-from-the-start relationship with the infamous drug lord. Yup, that’s a classic couple right there. #RelationshipGoals This is the plot, according to First Showing: Exciting stuff. I know I’m intrigued. It stars real-life couple Penélope Cruz and Javier Bardem as Vallejo and Bardem, respectively (who are DEFINITELY #RelationshipGoals, by the way). Cast members also includes Peter Sarsgaard, Julieth Restrepo, and David Valencia. Trailer time:  It’s not the only film about Escobar that’s out there – The Infiltrator and Paradise Lost, anyone? – but I suppose the “stormy affair” bit is the flick’s main selling point. Loving Pablo will be released in selected US theatres on June 15. Nothing about when it’ll hit South African shores. For now, please enjoy Cruz’s character saying the cheesiest line in the world: “I’ve seen things, Pablo, when I was with you…” Yes, I’m sure she’s seen many, many things while being with a bloody drug lord.
