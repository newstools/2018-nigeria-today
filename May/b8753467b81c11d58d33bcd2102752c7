We all know that smoking can be bad for one’s health. In fact, South Africa’s new draft law will basically wipe out smoking forever and save us all from the plight of tobacco addiction. Or something like that. But it seems like Emmanuel Macron doesn’t know that tidbit about smoking being a bad thing, since he’s reportedly planning to give Prince Harry a cigarette lighter as a wedding gift. Before you scoff, it’s not just any old lighter from a corner shop. The President of France is getting a golden lighter that’s part of a James Bond collection, explained The Telegraph: Check out this bad boy:  If this isn’t a direct reference to The Man with the Golden Gun, I’ll be so friggin’ upset. Meghan Markle apparently wants her fiancé to cut down on his ciggie intake: We know that Harry is currently shredding for the wedding at that high-end London gym, so bad timing, Macron, bad timing. The choice of a golden cigarette is yet to be confirmed “100” percent, though. Perhaps Macron has another gift in mind: Let’s hope whatever Macron has up his sleeve meets Markle’s approval. Probably not, but it’s fun to imagine. [source:telegraph]   Follow us on twitter @NigeriaTodayNG Also, Like us on facebook This post was syndicated from 2oceansvibe.com.
