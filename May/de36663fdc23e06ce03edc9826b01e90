A former aide to ex-president Goodluck Jonathan has advised the Economic and financial crime commission to go after president Muhammadu Buhari if they are looking for the real yahoo boys. Reno stated this on his Twitter. According to Reno, Buhari won the 2015 election by tricking Nigerians with fake promises. “EFCC arrested Yahoo boys at Club 57. But isn’t Yahoo obtaining by trickery? Buhari obtained the @NGRPresident by trickery” he tweeted. “He gave Nigerians fraudulent promises he never intended to keep such as ₦40 fuel and making ₦1 equal to $1. EFCC should face Buhari, the real Yahoo Man! “I wholeheartedly support the clampdown on financial crimes, but it should be made clear that not everyone who lives large at a club is automatically a 419. “I hope the raid on Club 57 was based on intelligence and not just arbitrary. It is not a crime to be rich and ostentatious.” he added    Follow us on twitter @NigeriaTodayNG Also, Like us on facebook
