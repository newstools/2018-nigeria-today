The Joint Health Sector Union (JOHESU) has disagreed with the Nigeria Medical Association (NMA) on the sustenance of a wide gap in salary structure between doctors and other health sector workers. Mr Olusola Adediji, the Chairman of JOHESU, Federal Medical Centre, Owo, Ondo, expressed the union’s position while speaking to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Friday in Akure. Adediji said there was no sincerity in the statement credited to the NMA on the application of the principle of “relativity” on the take-home pay for the two unions in the health sector, noting that there exists differences in the salaries of members NMA and JOHESU.
