Departing Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has predicted that Premier League football will be moved to midweek slots as a ‘European Super League’ dominates the weekend schedule in years to come. Arsene Wenger looked to the future, speculating on the subject the idea of a continental ‘super league’ – an idea he called ‘the next step’ for top level football. “The next evolution? Maybe I will see you in a few years and you will certainly have a European league over the weekends,” Wenger said “A domestic league will certainly play Tuesday, Wednesday. I think that is the next step we will see.” “Secret meetings” between league executives have taken place over the years to push the agenda of a ‘super league’, but the notion is a controversial one in England, where the Premier League reigns supreme. Indeed, Wenger also noted that England’s top tier had become “the world championships” of domestic football. Arsene Wenger spoke on a range of topics in front of the assembled press and, answering the question of which result would he change if he could, claimed “the last pain is the biggest one” – referencing his side’s Europa League semi final exit to Atletico Madrid last month. He added: “The Champions League final [defeat to Barcelona] was 2006, 12 years ago. But my last pain, the last big defeat, is that [Atletico Madrid].” The post Arsene Wenger Predicts European Super League Will Eventually Replace The Premier League appeared first on 360Nobs.com.
