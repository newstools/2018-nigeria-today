Manchester United midfielder Ander Herrera has claimed that “two or three mistakes” cost his club the chance to challenge for the Premier League title this season. United have already secured second spot in the Premier League table, but saw Manchester City land the title in the middle of last month, and Pep Guardiola’s side currently have a 19-point lead at the summit. Herrera has said that the Red Devils “can be unconcerned” with their work this season due to the fact that City have been “practically impeccable” throughout the campaign. “We can be unconcerned about all the work we’ve done. I think that being at the second place is also worthy because the champions were practically impeccable,” Herrera told ESPN Brasil. “They did not make any mistake this season but we’ve made two or three mistakes against teams we should have probably beaten and that did not allow us to contend for the title.” The post Manchester City Have Been Impeccable This Season – Ander Herrera appeared first on 360Nobs.com.
