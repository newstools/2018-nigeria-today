Queens Park Rangers (QPR) have announced the sack of its manager Ian Holloway with immediate effect with reports claiming that former England boss Steve McClaren is favourite to take over at Loftus Road. The decision comes after Holloway met QPR owner Tony Fernandes for talks following their 16th place finish in the Championship. Holloway returned to Loftus Road for his second stint as manager in November 2016. During his time at the club, he oversaw 80 games, winning 26, drawing 14 and losing 40. McClaren, who last worked as an adviser at Israeli said Maccabi Tel Aviv, is the favourite to replace Holloway. The 57-year-old previously worked at QPR as part of Harry Redknapp’s backroom team in 2013. A QPR statement said an announcement regarding Holloway’s replacement “will be made in due course.” The post BREAKING: QPR Sack Manager Ian Holloway With Immediate Effect appeared first on 360Nobs.com.
