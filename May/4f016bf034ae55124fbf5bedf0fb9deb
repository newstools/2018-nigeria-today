It’s Mother’s Day this Sunday, so best you don’t get too wrecked on Saturday night because nobody likes you with a hangover. At the very least I assume you’re buying your mother flowers (if you are the mother, my condolences), which you can pick up the day before. Fail to do so, and you might be looking at a situation where you’re going in giftless. The Lonely Island have experience in that field, because when Andy Samberg and Justin Timberlake were released from jail post-Dick in a Box they found themselves in that exact position. They had a solution, and that solution comes with plenty of swearing and sexual innuendo (no, in your endo). Take it away, boys:  Happy Mother’s Day to all my fans. That’s you, mom.
