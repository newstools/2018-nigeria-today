Camps Bay beach came alive when the Café Caprice annual beach volleyball tournament went down back in February, and I’ve got to admit that it looked like a real lekker jol. Ending off the summer with a bang, 24 teams faced off on the sandy court to determine who was the cream of the crop. Indeed, the #SavannahSummer beach series brought out the very best from the players who represented Cape Town’s top modelling agencies. Needless to say, balls were flying, hard-fought victories were won, and good times were had by all. Not to mention all the popsicles that were eaten. If you missed out on the action, check out the sizzling highlights from the tourney:  Nice! Caprice really topped itself this year. Don’t worry – if this video is making you all hot, bothered and longing for summer, pop in at Caprice and quench your thirst with their Scents of Summer drinking selection. This includes wicked concoctions like Strawberry Blonde – muddled strawberries with basil and cracked pepper (R85) – and Hennessey Sours, a fruity delight made up of Hennessey VSOP, fresh orange, Angosturo orange bitters, vanilla syrup and cellulose (R125).  Yeah, I’ll have me some of that. By now you should know all about Caprice’s food menu, famous for the ultra delicious burgers, including their classic American burger. Two luscious beef patties, cheddar and mozzarella, mustard, ketchup and house pickle, all for R90.  Yum, yum, YUM!
