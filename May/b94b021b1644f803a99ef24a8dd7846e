A former governor of Edo state, Adams Oshiomole has declared his intention to contest for the National Chairman of the All People Congress (APC) Oshiomole made his intention known at an event in Transcorp Hilton Hotel, Abuja. According to the former Labour leader, the current chairman John Odigie-Oyegun has done very well but the conservative notion and constitutional provision for new blood and new ideas from time to time inform his decision. Oshiomole thanked Oyegun for being very instrumental in the party victory in 2015 and maintained that history will never forget Oyegun for his contribution to the party. “It is right to appreciate the efforts of the sitting chairman, my own brother, my own elder but also my predecessor the first governor of Edo state John Odigie-Oyegun,” he said. “I want to place on record my gratitude and my appreciation of the leadership he has provided. Whatever anybody wants to say I believe he chaired the party to victory in the 2015 election and history will record that in his favour along with other laudable things he has done to keep our party afloat up to this moment. “I am seeking to contest for the same office based on the principle that in the 21st century, in the past the conservative notion was if it is not broken you don’t mend it but in the digital world anything and everything can be better. “I am contesting not because I think it is a leadership failure, I am contesting because I think as it is expected in our constitution of our party and even of our country, democracy works better when from time to time new blood new ideas are allowed.
