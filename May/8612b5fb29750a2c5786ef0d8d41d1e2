CSP Sulu-Gambari Abdul the divisional police officer at the national assembly has pointed accusing fingers at some lawmakers as well as a section of the national assembly security to be responsible for the invasion of the senate chambers during which the maze was snatched. According to him, while briefing an investigative pane constituted by the senate president on the matter, CSP Abdul said ordinarily, there should be cooperation between security agencies and the lawmakers but, in this case, the attack came from the roof as the senators are not helping security matters. “On April 16, there was hint that a group planned to invade the National Assembly and disrupt activities, which called for a build-up of security with two units of mobile police mobilised to the complex. “However, on April 18, at about 11am, my attention was drawn to a group protesting at the gate, and, while I moved to address the group, I was informed that some people were running away with the mace. “I signalled all the entry points that nobody drives in or out but three men approached me identifying themselves as security operatives and requested to be allowed to go. “The strain of blood on their clothes made me suspicious and I ordered their arrest. “In all, six people were arrested same day and handed over to the Force Headquarters alongside charms recovered from them. “In addition, an unmarked Prado jeep and a Toyota Hilux were impounded and they are with the police. “It was later that I observed that the protest was a diversionary attention to move me out and that the protesters were same group with those who attacked,’’ he stated.
