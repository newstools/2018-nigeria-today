Three years after the release of her widely acclaimed debut “Seyi or Shay” album, Seyi Shay is back with a new extended play titled “Electric Package”. With the Electric Package EP, the singer embraces her wholeness as it embodies all of the musical influences and changes she has accommodated in the past years. It is a punch of indigenousness as litters of African elements are scattered throughout the project. To further solidify her intention to diversify, Seyi recruits pan African music heavyweights; Vanessa Mdee from Tanzania, King Promise from Ghana, Nigeria’s Kiss Daniel, Slim Case and an array of top African DJs including; Spinall, DJ Consequence and many others. The 6-track Electric Package EP is simply a musical buffet. Hit play below to listen to “Alele” ft Flavour and DJ Consequence; the lead single off the project.
