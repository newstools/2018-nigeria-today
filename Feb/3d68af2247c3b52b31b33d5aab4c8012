We are products of our past, but we don’t have to be prisoners of it. ― Rick Warren Mistakes are part of life, we grow and learn from it. It very okay to make mistake but its not okay to let it control you. We all make mistakes, the problem is not making a mistake, the problem is your reaction after making the mistake. “You are much more than your mistakes, much bigger than your failures and much more beautiful than your ugliest moment. The stumbles we experience in life may shame us or humble us with valuable tough lessons but they will never define who we truly are. No matter your mistake…it’s important to remember that You are someone’s light in the darkness; a beacon of love and hope and that should ALWAYS supersede the superficial imperfections we erroneously internalize – Jason Versey The worst thing you can do it to dwell in regret after making a mistake, oh dear, you are more than that. Don’t let regrets overshadow the sparkle of your happiness.
