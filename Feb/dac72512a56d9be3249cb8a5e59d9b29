Biodun Okeowo, Nigeria actress rained curses on a fan who accused her of not taking care of her mother who is in the village. The Troll accused her of neglecting her mother in Ijebu town only to be posting pictures on Instagram. The troll cursed her and reminded her that her children will do the same to her. The fan wrote : “Your mama dey starve for Ijebu, you dey do fashion parade anyhow here. All those two children sef, you no go reap the fruit of your labour on them in Jesus name.” Reacting to the comment, Biodun debunked the news that she neglected her mother. She informed the troll that her mother is presently staying with her in Lagos. She further cursed the troll. She put all the curse n the bible on the troll. She wrote: “Good morning fams! I overlook most things but when it comes to curses and that, that has to do with my kids I don’t keep calm. Please fams one word for this idiot. Because right now I don’t understand why some people will hide under private account to perpetrate an evil act like this. A curse on a mum who’s struggling on her kids…. Girl I place all the curses in the Bible on you @ola_mi_degbogbo awon abiyamo aye ati orun won a panu po sepe fun e
