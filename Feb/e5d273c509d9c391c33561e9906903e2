Robert Lewandowski has slammed suggestions that he changed his agent, because he is looking at a move to Madrid. The Poland international has signed with super agent, Pini Zahavi, with the agent taking on one of football’s top striker. Lewandowski has scored over 20 goals in the Bundesliga this season, achieving this milestone six out of the seven years he has spent in Germany. His form in front of goal sees him continually linked with Real Madrid. The 29-year-old has, however, once again moved to distance himself from the rumours and play down the importance of a change in representative, telling reporters: “No, that [agent change] has nothing to do with this speculation. “I haven’t heard anything from Real Madrid, I don’t know whether my agent has and people will write what they want, but it doesn’t interest me.” The post Lewandowski: Madrid Yet To Make Contact appeared first on 360Nobs.com.
