By Bartholomew Madukwe A banker, Nsa Ayi, was, yesterday, charged before a Lagos State High Court sitting in Ikeja, for allegedly diverting N700 million from customers’ accounts. The defendant was arraigned by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, on an 11-count charge of fraudulent accounting. It was gathered that the defendant, a former Relationship Officer of a bank (name withheld), allegedly connived with unknown parties to move funds, using customers’ electronic instructions meant for investment in Federal Government’s bonds, treasury bills and fixed deposits. The prosecution informed the court that the defendant altered instructions and falsified signatures of customers to transfer money into various accounts outside the bank in tranches. However, the defendant pleaded not guilty. The trial judge, Justice Mojisola Dada, adjourned the case to March 6, 26, 29 and April 16 and 27.
