Inter Milan director, Piero Ausilio is quite confident a deal will be agreed with Mauro Icardi, as they are in touch with his agent. The Argentina international striker still has a contract till the 2020-21 season, but his agent and wife, Wanda Nara says she has been contacted by two clubs for his signature. Madrid are reportedly looking at Icardi as replacement for Benzema and United were linked with him in winter. Nevertheless, Ausilio insist they have the resources to retain him. “We are in constant contact with Icardi’s agent, aimed at the common goal of seeing if the future can be shared together and above all it’ll be done in silence,”  he told  Mediaset Premium. “The more talk there is, the more decisions get bumped down the road. “We want to engage in action, not words, and make sure everyone is in the right condition to give their best on the field. “If you list all the players in the squad, you’ll realise we are not that poor. There are many big names here, including several watching from the bench, because this team was constructed with a certain logic to target a Champions League place.” The post Ausilio: Icardi Renewal Will Happen appeared first on 360Nobs.com.
