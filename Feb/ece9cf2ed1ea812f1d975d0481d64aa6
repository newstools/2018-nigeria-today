The Chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission INEC Professor Mahmood Yakubu said it prepared the 2019 general election timetable under extant laws and that nothing has changed about it. Prof. Yakubu made the disclosure yesterday at a regular consultative meeting with the media in Abuja. According to him, the Commission issued the Timetable and Schedule of Activities for the 2019 General Elections based on its powers and extant laws and nothing has changed. “On 9th January, we issued the Timetable and Schedule of Activities for the 2019 General Elections based on our powers and extant laws and nothing has changed. There is a principle behind the choice of these dates- as our democracy matures, we should be moving from uncertainty to certainty. “As far as the Commission is concerned, there is no legal lacuna for now; we are working based on existing laws. But if something happens tomorrow, we will come out clear and tell Nigerians, but I think we are not operating based on conjectures,” he  said. Speaking further, the INEC boss reiterated that the Commission had finished all the preparatory steps for the 2019 general elections, adding that practical steps had been taken to implement provisions of the Election Project Plan (EPP).
