Ethereum classic price is placed nicely above supports against the US Dollar and Bitcoin. ETC/USD has to surpass the $35.00 resistance to trade further higher.

The pair declined recently and tested the 50% Fib retracement level of the last wave from the $32.93 low to $35.88 high. The downside move was limited below the $34.00 level. Moreover, the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the last wave from the $32.93 low to $35.88 high is also a decent support on the downside.
