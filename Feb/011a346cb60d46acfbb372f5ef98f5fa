Senator representing Kano Central in the national assembly, Senator Rabiu Kwankwaso, says the recent underage voters seen during the last local council poll in Kano state was the first in Nigeria’s history. The senator disclosed this in an  interview with Osasu Igbinedion on The Osasu Show.  According to Kwankwaso, such can only happen in an election contested by only one party. He said the scenario will be different in 2019, since the people are aware of the ‘mago mago’ and would be forced to send the children home if the show up at the venue of the elections. He advised the All Progressive Congress (APC) to do much more that they have done in the last three years to earned the trust of Nigerians and make sure that by 2019, the APC can win easily.  “This last one year is very crucial for the party, the government and the country.” He said “I think they (children) were invited to go and thumbprint because the real people were not there, the Kwakwansiya and the PDP weren’t there. “This is the first time I can see only children on the line or queue trying to vote I am seeing the type of thing that is happening. “The issue of decamping or leaving APC is not on the table now. We are looking at how the various stakeholders in our party will look at the situation, not only in Kano but there are many other places that something should be done “People who understand democracy go into politics first and foremost as politicians. From 1991 to date, I contested 16 elections and won 14 and lost two.” Do you have something awesome to share with the world?
