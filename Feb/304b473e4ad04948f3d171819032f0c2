Since today was the last day for our fasting n prayer, when I got back from my usual bizness “I decided to parboil the rice, that when I get back from church, I will come n prepare jollof rice. On getting back from church, I made the stew n when it’s time for me to pour the rice I used my hands n noticed that it was like rubber. “I decided to practicalise what I used to see online, only for me to see that it was bouncing so hard  Sometimes we don’t see the unseen battles and miracles God fight for us. The testimony of being alive is a great one. Since regulatory bodies ain’t doing their duties, please friends let’s be careful n watch what we eat because we are what we eat.”
