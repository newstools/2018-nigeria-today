Nasarawa state senator Abdullahi Adamu has come down hard on opponents of President Muhammadu Buhari calling them ‘ungodly’ and in realitydeceiving themselves. The former chairman of the Northern Senators Forum while speaking at a meeting of APC stalwarts in Keffi the Nsarawa state capital said he had no regrets supporting the president for a second term in office. “I am under oath as a member of the Distinguished Senate of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, and my oath of office compels me to be loyal, to be patriotic in the course of promoting the well-being, existence and unity of Nigeria. And the sovereignty of this country is expressed symbolically in the office of the president of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. And today as we talk, the person God has chosen to be the president of this country, the symbol of the sovereignty of this nation is President Muhammadu Buhari. “Those who don’t accept this are being ungodly. Those who don’t accept this reality are deceiving themselves more than any other person, and they should be careful of the wrath of God Himself,” he said. He said APC members who were not satisfied with the progress the present administration was making should leave the party and allow for a sustained developmental program in the country. “You don’t want the party for any reason, you feel you are not part of it, get out of it,” he said.
