That above is Heather Locklear in the 90s, when she was starring in Spin City and Melrose Place and life was good. Unfortunately for Locklear, her name is now back in the news for all the wrong reasons. Responding to a 911 call at around 9:40PM on Sunday evening, police arrived at her house in Thousand Oaks, California. According to PEOPLE, Locklear wasn’t willing to cooperate: The Ventura County PD have also released Locklear’s mugshot to the public, and it’s not one she’ll be hanging from the bedroom wall:  Then again, who really looks good in a mugshot? Tiger Woods certainly didn’t. Locklear’s boyfriend, Chris Heisser, has since been arrested for DUI, so not a good weekend for the couple, then. This isn’t Heather’s first brush with the law, because over the past decade she has been in the news rather regularly: September 2008: Arrested on Suspicion of DUI April 2010: Arrested for Hit-and-Run In January of 2012 she was hospitalised following a 911 call, with sources saying she may have mixed alcohol and prescription medication. Sources also say she entered rehab in January 2017, and was hospitalised after a crash in September of the same year. Let’s just hope she gets the help she needs, because it appears that things may have gone a little off the tracks these past few years.
