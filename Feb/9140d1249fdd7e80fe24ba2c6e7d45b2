A former chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission INEC Profesor Attahiru Jega says political parties with no wide citizens appeal do not stand a chance in Nigeria’s political terrain. According to him, only the big political parties with a nationwide appeal can win elections in Nigeria. Jega who was speaking yesterday as a guest lecturer at the 40th anniversary celebration of the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) also blamed past military administrations for the seeming lack luster labour movement in Nigeria. “Indeed, the NLC was banned between 1994 and 1998, and its offices occupied by an administrator appointed by the military, through which the complete destabilisation of the labour movement was achieved and from which it took many years to begin to recover,” he said. According to him, the military government of General Ibrahim Babangida (rtd) succeeded in clamping down on the NLC, infusing divide and rule within its ranks and destabilising it.
