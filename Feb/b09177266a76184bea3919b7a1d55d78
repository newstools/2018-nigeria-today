A group of Igbo leaders in the country says the Igbo nation is not interested in the presidency, rather it will continue to canvass for a total restructuring of Nigeria. The group through one of its leaders Chief Guy Ikokwu, while meeting with the Senator Enyinnaya Abaribe-led Ohanaeze committee on collation of Igbo views on restructuring said the group is not interested in Igbo presidency now without restructuring. Rather it urged the presidency and the National Assembly to proceed with restructuring immediately. “The Federal Government or the centre should have less power than it has now. It should devolve power to the federating units. We agree with the South-West and the Middle Belt that the federating units should be the zones with the states under them. Each zone should have its constitution. There should be fiscal federalism and resource control. ‘’We are looking at six zones, three in the South and three in the North. The majority of Ndigbo believe, like the South-West, that the federating units should be the zones. With true restructuring, equality of zones, fiscal federalism and resources control, there will be no need for an additional state in the South-East. Each zone will be free to create as many states at it deems fit without recourse to the centre,” he said. Do you have something awesome to share with the world?
