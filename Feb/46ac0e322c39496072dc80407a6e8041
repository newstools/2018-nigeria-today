Manchester United defender, Chris Smalling believes finishing second has to be the lowest position United can finish. The Red Devils enjoyed success under Ferguson, winning 13 PL titles, and never finishing below third. However since he retired in 2013, United have struggled to finish in the top four. A frustrated title charge this season, has them fighting for second and Smalling feels they must hold on to it. The England defender said after helping to cement a standing in second with a 2-1 victory over fellow challengers Chelsea: “I think obviously we’ve been second for quite a while and that needs to be our bare minimum. “The fact we get to play Liverpool at home as well I think is a big advantage. “If we can separate ourselves from Chelsea and Liverpool and work our way up then we can do that. “But I think that’s our (goal) first and foremost.” The post Smalling: Second Place Is The Least For United appeared first on 360Nobs.com.
