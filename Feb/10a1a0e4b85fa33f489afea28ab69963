It’s been a while since we have seen one of these videos doing the rounds, and that’s a good thing. At the moment the details surrounding the video below remain sketchy, but it has been confirmed that the incident in question took place this past Sunday, February 25. According to the Citizen, a “Food Lover’s Market spokesperson revealed that the company is busy investigating the incident, and will provide a statement as soon as due investigative and disciplinary processes have been followed”. The allegation is that the incident is racially motivated, with as many as three people abusing the employee. According to this tweet from local comedian David Kau, the employee’s name is Banele Mdingazwe. A quick warning that there is bad language and some distressing footage below:  Kau also says the following: That, along with other claims, remains unsubstantiated. No matter what has gone up until that point, physical assault of this nature is unacceptable. I guess now we wait for that Food Lover’s Market spokesperson to let us know what their investigation uncovers. [sources:citizen&twitter] Do you have something awesome to share with the world?
