In reaction to the Consensual love making between the housemates of the ongoing TV reality show, BBNaija,  Reno Omokri has called both of the housemates Animals because only animals make love in the public. Former aide to Goodluck Jonathan also attacked Nigerians for praising them and calling them stars because of the act. He wondered how Nigeria is growing in indecency instead of Science and Technology. Reno Omokri wrote: “When I was a child, only animals had intercourse in the open for all to see. Now I am an adult, Nigerians call people who publicly have intercourse in a toilet, stars! If they are stars, it must be very dark over Nigeria! We have a culture. Not everything from the West is good!
“Instead of copying the West and Asia in science and technology, we want to copy and overtake the West in public indecency like#BBNaija where we celebrate youths publicly having intercourse in a toilet. It is barbaric. It is un-African. Animals not humans should behave that way!” Do you have something awesome to share with the world?
