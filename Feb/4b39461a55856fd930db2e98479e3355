The senate at plenary today vowed to avoid a repeat of what happened more than 3 years ago at the Government Girls Secondary School Chibok in Borno state, where over 200 girls were abducted by the Boko Haram sect. This commitment is coming on the heels of the latest attack by the same sect on the Government Girls’ Technical College, Dapchi, Yobe State, where many of the students are still missing. According to Senator Bukar Ibrahim who cited Orders 42 and 52, as at this morning 46 of the girls were still missing. In his remarks, senate leader Ahmad Lawan regretted that Boko Haram now see young girls as targets and according to him; “we need to be extra careful and we need to take extra measures in protecting our schools especially our female schools.” “There are no actual numbers of the girls missing, the police have their numbers and the school has a different number. The state Government has failed in performing the basic duties of protecting lives and properties,” he said. The senate in its ruling condemned the attack on the school and re-insurgence of Boko Haram, and subsequently urged the Federal Government to urgently recover the girls to avoid a repeat of what happened to the Chibok girls.
