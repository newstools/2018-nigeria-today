Governor of Yobe state, Ibrahim Gaidam has revealed that none of the students of Government Girls Science Technical College, Dapchi, Yobe state, in captivity of suspected Boko Haram insurgents, has been rescued. The governor disclosed this when he visited the community on Thursday by advising family members of the abducted students to keep praying for the girls to be found. This latest revelation is however conflicting to the statement issued by Abdullahi Bego, the spokesperson of the governor who had earlier claimed that all the students captured has been released. “The Yobe state government hereby informs the public that some of the girls at Government Girls Science Technical College (GGSTC) whose school was attacked by Boko Haram terrorists last Monday have been rescued by gallant officers and men of the Nigerian Army from the terrorists who abducted them,” the  governor had said in a statement which Abdullahi Bego, his spokesman, issued on his behalf. “The rescued girls are now in the custody of the Nigerian Army. We will provide more details about their number and condition in due course.” Do you have something awesome to share with the world?
