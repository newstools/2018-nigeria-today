Manchester City midfielder, Kevin De Bruyne has warned that City are not done winning trophies, after winning the Carabao Cup. Guardiola’s men capped a dominant performance with a 3-0 thrashing of Arsenal at Wembley. Goals from Sergio Aguero, David Silva and Vincent Kompany scored the goals and De Bruyne hailed the old favourites. “We deserved to win,” he told Sky Sports. “I think we have had a good feeling all season but it’s not finished yet, we know what we have to do in the league and Champions League. “We have to maintain the same focus. “I think the potential at this club is huge, with the squad we already have, it’s an amazing job and we play like the best in the world, it’s very exciting to play here.” The post De Bruyne: City Are Not Done appeared first on 360Nobs.com.
