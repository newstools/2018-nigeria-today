By Lanre Babalola Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Lagos State, Otunba Henry Ajomale has appealed to President Muhammadu Buhari to move fast and ensure that the committee he set up to reconcile warring members of the party did not fail in its assignment. Reacting to a letter written by the National Leader of the party, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu to the National Chairman of the party, Chief John Odigie-Oyegun, accusing the latter of sabotaging the effort of the committee, Ajomale said President Buhari should do something to ensure that all members of the party cooperate with the Tinubu-led presidential committee to achieve success as the 2019 election is around the corner. Tinubu had in his letter accused Oyegun of undermining the effort of the committee by hurriedly inaugurating a factional executive of the party in Kogi State without recourse to the committee.
