Andre Villas-Boas has hailed Manchester City as a spectacular side, and believes Guardiola has made an impact. Manchester City won their first trophy of the season, with the 3-0 thrashing of Arsenal in the Carabao Cup. And are also on course to win the EPL, with a 13-point lead over United and could qualify for the quarterfinal of the UCL. “In the league, they’re running away with it. [They won a] trophy on Sunday and their football is spectacular,” former Chelsea and Tottenham boss Villas-Boas said at the Laureus Awards. “It took one year for Guardiola to settle, but the way the team is playing now is fantastic. “Not only that, but it’s the consistency in terms of results. This consistency means that they go into every game with a lot of confidence.  “With such young players and quality players, they are really a team to look out for.”  The post Villas-Boas: City Are Spectacular appeared first on 360Nobs.com.
