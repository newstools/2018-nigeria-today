Ondo state governor Arakunrin Rotimi Akeredolu says the recently constituted Presidential reconciliation committee headed by All Progressives Congress APC chieftain Bola Ahmed Tinubu is not needed in the state. According to the governor, there was peace in the party in the state as most of the party bigwigs have returned back to the party. “All is well with APC in Ondo State; we are waxing stronger. Olusola Oke has just returned to stay longer, so Asiwaju Tinubu has no reason to come here.” “Where there is peace, you don’t need a peacemaker so you don’t create more problems. The Presidential reconciliation committee is not needed here in Ondo State; there is peace in Ondo APC.”  Do you have something awesome to share with the world?
