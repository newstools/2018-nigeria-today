Nigerian Consul-General  in Guangzhou China, Wale Oloko has warned Nigerians intending to visit China to understand Chinese immigration requirement first before taking any steps. Oloko who issued this warning in Lagos on Monday admitted that there was so many Nigerians lavishing in Chinese prison due to immigration offences. He advised Nigerians who are living in China to obey Chinese rule and uphold the dignity of Nigeria. “Any Nigerian wanting to visit any part of China must first know something about the country’s immigration requirements and should be ready to obey laws in such places when they eventually arrive there. It is not advisable for any Nigerian to overstay his or her visa in any part of China or engage in any form of criminal act. “There is no doubt that there are currently a number of Nigerians in various Chinese prisons, at least those under our consular jurisdiction in Guangzhou. These our nationals are in different Chinese prisons for various offences. There are those that were arrested for overstaying their visas, while others were convicted for drug trafficking and other offences.” ” Do you have something awesome to share with the world?
