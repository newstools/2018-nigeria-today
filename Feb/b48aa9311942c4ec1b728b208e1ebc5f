Former Arsenal star, Ray Parlour believes the club should turn to Patrick Vieira as a replacement for Arsene Wenger. Pressure continues to mount on Wenger, who was in the dugout for Arsenal’s shambolic defeat to City in the Carabao Cup final. Parlour has charged Arsenal to work on a replacement, as Wenger looks to be losing his touch and he believes Vieira is an obvious choice. The ex-Arsenal midfielder told Sky Sports: “The club need a plan behind the scenes now. “They may decide to go with an inexperienced person like Patrick Vieira or Thierry Henry. “Or do we want to go with someone who has Champions League experience like Diego Simeone? “Obviously then there’s Carlo Ancelotti, who has managed some of the biggest clubs in the world. “But the one I would take a gamble on, and I think he’d be given time, is Patrick Vieira.  “He’s managed in New York. He knows the club very well and he knows the history of the club. “I think he could attract big players and I think the fans would give him a chance as well.” The post Parlour: Vieira Should Replace Wenger appeared first on 360Nobs.com.
