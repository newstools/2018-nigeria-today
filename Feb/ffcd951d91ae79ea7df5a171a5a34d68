The eccentric bassist of the Red Hot Chili Peppers laid bare his struggles with addiction in an opinion piece he wrote for TIME called “The Temptation of Drugs Is a Bitch”. An apt title in many ways, Flea went on to attack the prescription of the controversial opioid painkiller OxyContin. You know, the stuff that has led America into the midst of a massive epidemic. Born Michael Balzary, Flea explained that he began toking at the age of 11, before he “proceeded to snort, shoot, pop, smoke, drop and dragon chase my way through my teens and 20s”:  But then, following a surgery for a broken arm after a snowboarding accident, Flea was prescribed OxyContin:  The piece was published as a part of TIME’s “The Opioid Diaries”, a visual record of a national emergency and a call to action.  According to The Guardian, the opiate painkiller OxyContin is manufactured by Purdue Pharma, who made an estimated $1,8 billion (R21,2 billion) from sales of the drug last year. However, opioids are the leading cause of death among under-50s in the US, and have recently claimed high-profile lives in the music industry like Prince, Tom Petty and rapper Lil Peep:  Flea’s piece, which is a relatable inside look at the opioid crisis as well as a person’s relationship with addiction, ends with this gem: Read his full piece here.
