The Independent National Electoral Commission INEC says it is intensifying efforts to give Nigerian prison inmates voting rights in the 2019 general elections. INEC Secretary in Kebbi State, Alhaji Bello Magaji Isah while on a courtesy visit to the Controller of Prison in Kebbi State, Mallam Sani Adamu Potiskum said the Commission is working on the possibility of creating polling units in Nigerian prisons to allow some categories of inmates to vote. “The essence is to capture as many eligible voters to participate in the election since voters’ education and sensitisation are very essential in this regard. “We also consider the feasibility of inmates in custody and the plight of Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs), Persons With Disabilities (PWDs) and People in Diaspora to Vote in elections,” he said. In his comments, Controller of Prisons Kebbi State, Mallam Potiskum said he had been instructed by the Controller General, Ja’afaru Ahmed to provide all necessary supports in ensuring that INEC succeeds in its campaign on Inmates’ rights to vote even though they lack rights to be voted.
