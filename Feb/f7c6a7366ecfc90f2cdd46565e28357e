You don’t have to be a genius to know that, after the success of Stranger Things, we were set for a wave of shows about awkward, geeky teenagers. Some are going to miss the mark, and do so by a long way, and you’ll have to make your own mind up about Everything Sucks!. It’s 1996, and you’ve just arrived at high school. Or middle school – it’s set in America, and who really knows how their school system plays out. The peeps at Vulture are already in deep: Yup, it does:  I suppose it’s kind of similar to the Spud movies, except not a giant piece of shite. Not sure that any of these kids will ascend to the fame level enjoyed by Millie Bobby Brown (she’s 14 and has 15 million Instagram followers), but you have to start somewhere. Also, if Showmax wants to continue with the quality local content and produce something about going to school in the 90s in South Africa, we are ready.
