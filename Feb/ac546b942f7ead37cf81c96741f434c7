Chelsea midfielder, Danny Drinkwater believes Manchester United did not deserve to beat the Blues. Conte’s men controlled proceedings and deservedly went ahead via a fine goal from Willian. However, the equaliser came before the break from Lukaku. And United completed their comeback after the break via Lingard. Drinkwater feels the loss was unfair to Chelsea and they deserved to get something. “We definitely should have got something from the game,” Drinkwater told Chelsea’s official website. “In the first half we were very dominant. In the second half it was a bit different, it was more even, but we didn’t deserve to lose that game, no chance. “I don’t know the stats, but the first half felt good. Their goal came out of nowhere. We had a bit of confidence coming into the second half, but it didn’t go our way. “It was more of a battle which suited them and took the game away from us. “Football goes against you sometimes and it was one of those days. There are obviously bits we could have improved on, but we have to got to look forward and on to the next game now. “It’s down to us. We have got to get our performances and our results in order and hopefully our position will look after itself.” The post Drinkwater: Chelsea Did Not Deserve To Lose appeared first on 360Nobs.com.
