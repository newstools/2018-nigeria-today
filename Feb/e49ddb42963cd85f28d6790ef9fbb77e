Co-convener of the Bring Back Our Girls Group, BBOG, Aisha Yesufu has faulted remarks by Nigeria’s Information Minister Lai Mohammed over the alleged abduction of school girls from the Government Girls Science and Technical College, Dapchi in Yobe state saying the Federal Government’s lack of understanding was terrible. Alhaji Lai Mohammed had earlier while speaking to journalists in Dapchi said the attack on the school was a sign of desperation by the Boko Haram sect to embarrass the Federal Government. “This can’t be true. How can Lai Mohammed be talking about government image when people’s daughters have been abducted and only God knows what they are going through? “Does he understand the pain their families are going through,” she wrote on her official Twitter page.
