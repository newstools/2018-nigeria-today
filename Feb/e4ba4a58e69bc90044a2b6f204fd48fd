Eric Dier believes that Tottenham will benefit from the attributes of Lucas Moura. Lucas Moura is still waiting for his first start in the Premier League, but Dier has revealed his excitement after beginning to work with the attacker. The 24-year-old is quoted by ESPN as saying: “He is going to bring exactly what you saw from him. He’s direct. He’s fast. Technically, he’s very good, even though he’s travelling at a high speed a lot of the time. I think one of his qualities that I really enjoy is that even though he’s fast and moves at pace, he still sees a pass and he’s still intelligent. “Sometimes it’s difficult for players that have these attributes to still have the calmness in the final third and see the right pass and the right situation, and I think that’s a great quality that he has to go along with his other attributes.” The post Eric Dier Impressed By Tottenham’s New Signing Lucas Moura appeared first on 360Nobs.com.
