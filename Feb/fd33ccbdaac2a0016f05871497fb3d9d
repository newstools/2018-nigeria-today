Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger wants  Jack Wilshere’s future at the club resolved “very quickly”. Jack Wilshere is out of contract at the Emirates this summer and is thought to have been offered a new deal that will see his basic wage cut from £110,000 a week to £90,000. The proposal includes heavy financial incentives, however, meaning that Wilshere, who has spent more than 1,000 days of his senior career on the sidelines with injury, could earn significant bonuses to top up his wage if he remains fit and hits performance targets. Asked about the latest situation with talks over the new deal, Wenger told reporters: “That decision doesn’t depend only on me. But I want him to sign very quickly. “He is still to make a decision and to find a pen somewhere, I am happy to give him one.” The post Arsene Wenger Wants Quick Resolution To Jack Wilshere’s Contract Situation appeared first on 360Nobs.com.
