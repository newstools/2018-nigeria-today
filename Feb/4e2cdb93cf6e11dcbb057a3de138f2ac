There are some schools in South Africa that are never going to struggle for cash. You have to sell off a few organs to send your kids through the likes of Hilton and Michaelhouse (the latter is in excess of R265 000 PER YEAR), and other schools have seriously cashed up past pupils to bolster their coffers. Shout out to Elon Musk, who gave his old school in Pretoria R1 million and told them never to contact him again. The latest donation under the microscope comes via disgraced Steinhoff philanderer Markus Jooste, who sent a cool R10 million to Afrikaanse Hoër Seunskool, better known as Affies, having matriculated there in 1978. So, what does one do with the cash, given what has come out since the donation was handed over? Here’s Business Insider SA:  Nice to rack up the interest on that R10 million while you’re waiting to make a call on the matter. I suppose they’re stuck between a rock and a hard place.
