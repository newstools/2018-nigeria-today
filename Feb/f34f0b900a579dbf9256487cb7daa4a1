Nasarawa state senator Abdullahi Adamu has revealed why he was eased out as the chairman of the northern senators forum by the senate. Senators during plenary on Wednessday had submitted a letter to the senate president notifying him of a change in the leadership of the forum saying it had replaced Senator Adamu and replaced him with Senator Aliyu Wamakko from Sokoto state. But in a reaction to his ouster, Adamu claimed his critical stand on the letter former president Obasanjo wrote to President Muhammadu Buhari as well as his position on the reordering of sequence of elections led to his removal. “There was no sitting at all (to discuss his removal); I was at the Senate but left to attend to a manager from one of the banks and while I was with him, some colleagues came in to say some handful of senators, Dino (Melaye) went with some papers to see the presiding officer, Ike Ekweremadu, the Deputy Senate President that some Northern senators have signed that they would remove me as chairman of the Northern Senators Forum. “I was not elected that way; this is just like throwing something at me because of what I said on Wednesday on amendment to the Electoral Act. “They just want to smear me and they are trying to justify it. They can’t use my contribution on the electoral bill because they would be scolded by the public. They don’t want to use my position on Obasanjo, so they bring the issue of money. I would not be deterred, I would continue with my work as a senator,” he said.    Do you have something awesome to share with the world?
