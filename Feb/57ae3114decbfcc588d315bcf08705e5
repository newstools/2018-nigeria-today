As the Western Cape grapples with our drought problem, Capetonians have had to do away with luxuries like bathing and flushing the toilet.

So far we’re holding our own, pushing back Day Zero through a massive collective effort, but spare a thought for our province’s farmers. The industry has taken a significant knock (even the wine industry – horror!), and it’s left many farmers looking to make changes to the ways in which they operate. We’re not going to pretend that we’re farming experts, but how about this for a cherry-picked idea from Bizcommunity? Do you have something awesome to share with the world?
