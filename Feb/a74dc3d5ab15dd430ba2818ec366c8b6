Released in November 2017 CryptoKitties in the first week of its existence forced users to spend more than $ 3 million on ridiculous drawing kittens than significantly slowed all transactions on the network Ethereum, forcing the miners to raise commissions. At present, developers of the cryptokitties studio Axiom Zen earn well on selling the kittens and commissions generated by the system at 3.75% per transaction. Chinese crypto-enthusiasts did not take long to wait, and soon after the kittens announced the creation of HashPuppies, on the NEO network. In turn, the Chinese search engine Baidu has already launched its fun with crypto-puppies called Leci Gou, which allows you to sell, buy and exchange your dogs for blockchain. Contact Email Address
