It’s hot, there’s traffic, and your fridge is lacking some decent alcoholic beverages, so what you going to do? Instead of diverting your route home so you can hit the bottle store, the Bottles app is offering a lekker special on ice cold Sol Cerveza – delivered straight to your door. And they deliver WITHIN AN HOUR. Here’s the deal: a six pack of the light pale lager is going for R69, and a case for R279. Predrinks for Incubus? Not a bad way to start your Wednesday evening either way. The minimum order is R150, and to make it all the more worthwhile, Bottles is offering a R50 discount. Why? Because today is the last day of February. Just pop in the promo code BOTTLESTIME when checking out, and you’re good to go. Oh, if this is your first time, delivery is FREE.
