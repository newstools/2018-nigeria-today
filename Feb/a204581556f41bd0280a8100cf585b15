The senate today resolved to look into double registration allegations levelled against Kogi state senator Yahaya Bello, where it is claimed that the governor was issued another voters card from another ward different from his. Senator Mohammed Hassan citing order 43 said the Governor was involved in double registration and had 3 members of the Independent National Electoral Commission INEC sacked, got another voters card from another ward and claims he cannot be prosecuted because he has immunity. In his ruling, Senate President Bukola Saraki said; “Stability of our democracy lies on the stability of the electoral processes and as such we must ensure the processes are always fair such that we can be proud of.” Consequently, the senate president mandated the Chairman Senate Committee on INEC to look into the matter.
