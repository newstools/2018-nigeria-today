Kevin De Bruyne has been hailed as a star and a future Ballon d’Or winner by pundits and coaches alike, but Boniek believes the Belgium international is not as good as Piotr Zielinski. The Poland international midfielder has impressed for Napoli this season, scoring four goals, as they sit atop the table in a bid to win a first Scudetto since 1989-90. Sarri, Napoli’s manager has compared the 23-year-old to De Bruyne. Zielinski is regarded as one of the brightest talents in European football and Boniek, head of the Polish Football Association, already rates the 23-year-old above De Bruyne. “He will be the next De Bruyne? I think Zielinski already has more quality than De Bruyne,” Boniek said to Corriere dello Sport. “They are different kind of players, of course, but they have the same ability to leave their mark on the team. I think that he will become a top player. “He was 16, I went to see a Poland youth international match and thought: ‘This is an extraordinary player’.” The post Boniek: Zielinski Better Than De Bruyne appeared first on 360Nobs.com.
