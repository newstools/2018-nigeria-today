 The Bayelsa Chapter of the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC), says the state government has earmarked N100 million for the construction of the state secretariat. The state Chairman, Mr John Ndiomu, made this known in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Friday. Speaking against the backdrop of the celebration of NLC’s 40th anniversary in the state, Ndiomu expressed the union’s readiness to work with the present administration to end workers’ strike in Bayelsa. He lauded the Bayelsa Government for capturing the construction of the NLC Secretariat complex in its 2018 budget. He assured teachers who were wrongly sacked that they would soon be called back to their duty posts. “We are here to protect the interest of workers, not ours. “Even when people are not our union members, we still work to protect their interest as fellow countrymen.” He said that the anniversary would also create an opportunity to reflect on the challenges faced by the NLC and the larger labour movement and identify ways of addressing these challenges. NAN recalls that the NLC was founded  on Feb. 28, 1978. Do you have something awesome to share with the world?
