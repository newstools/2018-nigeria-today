If you’re not driving with your seat belt on you’re a fool, but that’s not going to help much when your car bursts into flames. Ford have themselves a nightmare on their hands with their Kuga range of cars, and now video has emerged of another vehicle catching alight. This one comes from just outside Estcourt in KZN, and happened last Friday. Sissy Mkhwanazi was the unfortunate driver, with her account from News24: After grabbing her handbag from the boot, she then moved to inspect the front and back tyres. At this point she saw the flames, and you can guess what happened next.  Not a very good look at all. According to Times LIVE, Ford haven’t covered themselves in glory since the incident: When you consider those numbers, zooming around in a Kuga seems like a chance many of us wouldn’t be willing to take.
