Tottenham midfielder Cristian Eriksen has claimed that his team-mates are hitting peak form at just the right time after recovering from a mid-season blip. Tottenham have recently taken seven points from a possible nine in Premier League games against Manchester United, Liverpool and Arsenal, while also holding Juventus to a well-earned 2-2 draw in the Champions League. Taking into account the underwhelming 2-2 draw with Rochdale in the FA Cup last time out, Spurs are now unbeaten in 14 matches since going down 4-1 to Manchester City before Christmas. That follows a run of five wins from 11 in October and November, and Eriksen hopes that Spurs are now firmly on track to bringing some silverware to North London. “I don’t know what it is about this time of year but it’s probably all about how we train – we work hard, especially in pre-season and we really pick up this time of year,” he told the club’s official website. “All I know is the team feels very confident and we’re going in the right direction. “We started the season well, had a dip and now we’ve really built up again over the last few months. There is still everything to play for in the Champions League and getting seven points from the games against United, Liverpool and Arsenal was a great achievement and gives us a lot of confidence going forward.” The post Tottenham Beginning To Hit Top Form At The Right Time- Cristian Eriksen appeared first on 360Nobs.com.
