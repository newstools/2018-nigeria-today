Chief Don Etiebet, Nigerias former Petroleum Minister says the only time Nigeria ever had good leadership was during the 1983/84 military regime of President Muhammadu Buhari. Speaking to journalists in Uyo, thee Akwa Ibom state capital, Etiebet said as of now, the government was doing everything possible to correct the rot it inherited from previous administrations. “The only time we had good leadership was in 1983/84, when this same Buhari led a coup and brought about some level of sanity.  I left this country before the civil war and came back in 1978, and I have been involved in a lot of politics,” he said. He admonished the critics of the president, saying it wasn’t true that the present administration had not made any meaningful progress. “Quote me, I have never seen an administration or a President that has done as much as Buhari has done to reposition this country to be a country or a nation of productivity. I mean a nation that can stand on its own and attain economic prosperity like other nations,” he said.   Do you have something awesome to share with the world?
