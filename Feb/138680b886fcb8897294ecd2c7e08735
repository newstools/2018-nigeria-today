The All Progressives Congress (APC), has refuted the reports by some media organisations that  the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) raided its national Secretariat on Abuja on Thursday describing it as ‘fake news’. A statement signed by the National Publicity Secretary of the ruling party, Bolaji Abdullahi, made available to BusinessDay on Friday said “our attention has been drawn to syndicated fake news published in some sections of the media that the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) ‘raided’ the National Secretariat of the All Progressives Congress (APC) on Thursday, February 22, 2018.” The statement added that the said report is completely false as nothing of such happened as reported even as it urged the public to ignore such report. “We once again appeal to media houses to fact check and verify information ascribed or relating to our Party from the official APC media channels,” the party added.
