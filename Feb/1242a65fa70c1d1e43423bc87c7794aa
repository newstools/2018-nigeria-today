With the Ozzies arriving on South Africa’s shores ahead of a four-test series, you can be sure that the Proteas lower-order is getting ready for a barrage of short-pitched bowling. Time and time again in the recent Ashes series Down Under, the Ozzie quicks blew through the English middle and lower order with some sweet chin music. What you don’t expect when you’re charging in to bowl, though, is the ball cannoning off your own noggin. Not just that, but flying over the boundary for a six. That’s exactly what happened to Canterbury bowler Andrew Ellis in New Zealand, after a shot by Jeet Raval came back his way. The umpire was even confused, initially signalling four before correctly calling it a maximum. If you pay close attention, you can see the ball flick up off Ellis’ head:  According to Stuff, he emerged unscathed:  One thing you can bet on is a no mercy approach from the Ozzie pace bowlers during the course of the test series. Then again, with KG, Morne and Lungi Ngidi (and Dale Steyn once fit), we can also dish it out. [source:stuff] Do you have something awesome to share with the world?
