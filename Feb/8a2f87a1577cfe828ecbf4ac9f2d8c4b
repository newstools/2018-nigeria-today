Following the alleged voting by minors in the last local government elections held in Kao state recently, a legal practitioner Mba Ukweni, SAN, has called for the prosecution of any official of the Independent National Electoral Commission INEC found wanting. Speaking with journalists in Calabar the Cross River state capital, Mr. Ukweni said it was wrong for INEC officials to register under age persons. “The Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, officials who indulged in registration of underage people should be brought to book and prosecuted for corruption. The age of voting is 18. It is wrong for INEC officials to register under age persons. “This is part of corruption. Corruption is not just somebody taking money. Anything that is done improperly in order to obstruct the proper course of things is corruption. Registration of underage people is corruption, so it should be investigated,” he said.
