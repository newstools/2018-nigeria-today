Geoffrey Kondogbia has revealed that if he had the money he would pay his own buyout clause to push through a move away from Inter Milan, according to Calciomercato. The French powerhouse, who is having the season of his career on loan at Valencia, doesn’t want to return to the San Siro. “If I had the money I’d do it. I’d use my money to pay my buy-out clause. Inter was a total chaos. I met four or five different managers in two years and players used to change every year. That’s why it is hard for a footballer, especially a young one, to establish himself at Inter.” “A top club need stability even if things are not good at the beginning; continuity and stability are absolutely needed. It’s hard to play well when players and managers change every time.” “My redemption set at €25million? If I had the money, I would pay from my own pocket,” he said.
