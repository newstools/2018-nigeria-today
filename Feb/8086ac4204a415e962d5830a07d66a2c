National leader of the All Progressives Congress, Bola Tinubu, has accused the chairman of the party, John Odigie-Oyegun, of sabotage. In a letter copied to President Muhammadu Buhari , vice-President Yemi Osinbajo, the Senate President, Bukola Saraki and the speaker of the house of representatives, Yakubu Dogara, Tinubu accused Oyegun of sabotaging his presidential assignment. The letter which was obtained exclusively by TheCable is dated February 21, 2018. The letter reads in parts: “Disappointment greeted me when I discovered that you had swiftly acted in contravention of the spirit of our discussions. Instead of being a bulwark of support as promised, you positioned yourself in active opposition to the goal of resuscitating the progressive and democratic nature of APC” Tinubu noted that Oyegun seeks to undermine his mandate by engaging in dilatory tactics for the most part. According to Tinubu, “When forced to act, you (Oyegun) do so in an arbitrary and capricious manner” Tinubu urged Odigie-Oyegun  to make available status reports and all the pertinent information regarding the state chapters of APC to him without further delay.
