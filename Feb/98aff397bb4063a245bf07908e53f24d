Kaduna state senator Shehu Sani has reacted to Nigeria’s latest rating by Transparency International calling it dismal and “a direct opposite of the marks and the applause we give to ourselves.” Sani who made the statements via his official Twitter page said; “Nigeria’s current corruption rating by the Transparency International is dismal. “It’s a direct opposite of the marks and the applause we give to ourselves. “We have a choice now; to condemn them as anti government or anti Nigeria or we reset our drive and make amends”. It would be recalled that Transparency International had rated Nigeria poorly over the perception of corruption. According to the latest index, while the country scored 27/100 and was ranked 136th in 2016, the latest CPI scores Nigeria 28/100 but with a rank of No. 148 out of 180 countries surveyed — a significant 12 places below where it was the previous year.
