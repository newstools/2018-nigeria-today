Apparently Grand Theft Auto (GTA), and video games like it, are one of the reasons school shootings happen. That’s if you listen to certain Republican politicians, who are on record as taking money from the NRA, but yeah, it’s the video games and movies, man. Funny, just up north Canada seem to watch those movies and play those games, but they’re not seeing schools shot up. Anyway, deep breaths – how about a high speed car chase that looks like something out of GTA? Here’s a play-by-play from VICE:  It’s after that collision that things go off-script: You’ll have to watch a crummy ad first, but hang in there:  Crafty. After the bait and switch, the vibe of those watching underwent a shift: I’m not even sure what ending would be considered happy at the point (mind out the gutter), but here’s the third video:  GAME. OVER. Apparently the city of LA ended up having to shut down its Metro Rail, so he probably wasn’t as popular with public transport users as he was with viewers. We love a good high-speed car chase, don’t we? [source:vice] Do you have something awesome to share with the world?
