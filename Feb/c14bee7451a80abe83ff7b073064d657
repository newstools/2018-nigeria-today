It was the year 2013. Mila Kunis, doing the rounds to drum up support for the movie Oz the Great and Powerful, sat down for an interview with Chris Stark. Less than three seconds in, and already Stark revealed he was “petrified”. 10 seconds later and BAM, he let slip that this was, in fact, his first interview of this kind. From there, Kunis and the rookie BBC reporter produced one of the coolest press interviews in the history of Hollywood, as they veered off script and began talking about football and beer. Soon, however, the two were interrupted by an off-camera publicist, instructing Kunis to bring the focus back to the movie. Responding with an eye roll, she then rattles off a list of the answers that she gives to every reporter. Watch the interview in full below and, if you want to fall in love with Mila all over again, head through to the 4:12 minute mark:  Best.
