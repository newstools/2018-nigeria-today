Pep Guardiola sees the Premier League as the most important trophy to win, and insists his men are focused on winning it. Manchester City face Arsenal on Thursday, four days after beating the gunners 4-0 to win the Carabao Cup. A comfortable first leg win over Basel and a 13-point lead in the PL, means City have a chance at doing the treble. And Guardiola insists his men are looking to win the Premier League more than any other trophy. “We are fighting for the most important title of the season, by far, the Premier League,” he told a pre-match news conference. “More than the Champions League, more than the FA Cup, more than the EFL Cup. “In football and sport you always forget what you have done, good or bad, and think about the next one.” The post Guardiola: Premier League Is The Most Important appeared first on 360Nobs.com.
